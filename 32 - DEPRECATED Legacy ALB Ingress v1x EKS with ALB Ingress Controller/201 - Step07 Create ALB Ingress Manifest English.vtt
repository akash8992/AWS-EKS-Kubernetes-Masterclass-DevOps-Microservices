00:00.000 --> 00:01.050
-: Welcome back.

00:01.050 --> 00:02.667
In this step we are going to create a

00:02.667 --> 00:06.990
ALB Kubernetes basic Ingress manifest. Okay?

00:06.990 --> 00:10.110
So let's go ahead and then create that now.

00:10.110 --> 00:12.390
So we are in our (mouse clicking)

00:12.390 --> 00:15.630
05-ALB Ingress basic YAML.

00:15.630 --> 00:17.610
The rest all are going to be same

00:17.610 --> 00:19.710
which is nothing but external name service,

00:19.710 --> 00:21.090
we are going to have.

00:21.090 --> 00:23.970
And user management deployment, we are going to have.

00:23.970 --> 00:26.610
And Kubernetes secrets as is,

00:26.610 --> 00:29.700
and user management node port service. Okay?

00:29.700 --> 00:33.030
So now ALB Ingress will pick the node port service.

00:33.030 --> 00:34.710
How we are going to see it?

00:34.710 --> 00:35.543
Now.

00:35.543 --> 00:36.870
Which means like, the backend,

00:36.870 --> 00:39.150
which is nothing but the targets inside the

00:39.150 --> 00:41.910
ALB ingress basic basic is going to be

00:41.910 --> 00:44.610
this respect to node port service.

00:44.610 --> 00:46.980
So we are going to reference that there, okay?

00:46.980 --> 00:49.317
So let me close this (mouse clicking)

00:49.317 --> 00:50.880
and then start writing first Ingress basic

00:50.880 --> 00:52.983
so we'll understand in a better way.

00:54.150 --> 00:57.390
So the Ingress is the (typing) kind here, okay?

00:57.390 --> 00:59.310
So this is AP version kind metadata

00:59.310 --> 01:02.220
and then spec, our standard Kubernetes stuff.

01:02.220 --> 01:05.224
And then I'm going to say Ingress

01:05.224 --> 01:06.736
(typing) and it is going to be

01:06.736 --> 01:07.800
(typing)

01:07.800 --> 01:12.800
extensions/v1beta1. Right?

01:12.900 --> 01:14.760
So currently this is in beta,

01:14.760 --> 01:18.270
but in future it might be modal way.

01:18.270 --> 01:20.340
So whenever it is updated to

01:20.340 --> 01:23.700
as usual when it is moved from beta to live.

01:23.700 --> 01:25.800
So I'm going to update it accordingly.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.410
But currently it is in V1, beta1,

01:28.410 --> 01:30.600
this entire Ingress section related to

01:30.600 --> 01:33.960
ALB, application load balancer. Okay?

01:33.960 --> 01:38.040
So we have created API version kind and then in metadata.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.810
So the title elements usually we'll have is

01:40.810 --> 01:42.336
(typing) name and then,

01:42.336 --> 01:44.700
(typing) labels, right?

01:44.700 --> 01:46.920
And name, I'm going to say

01:46.920 --> 01:48.353
(typing) ingress-usermgmtrestappservice.

01:52.770 --> 01:53.603
Okay?

01:53.603 --> 01:57.540
And in the labels as usual, this is our standard label

01:57.540 --> 02:00.060
we are going to put for our user (typing)

02:00.060 --> 02:02.544
user management microservice, which is nothing but

02:02.544 --> 02:03.794
(typing) usermgmtrestapp.

02:05.130 --> 02:06.060
Okay?

02:06.060 --> 02:08.880
And one more we are going to have as part of this

02:08.880 --> 02:13.260
which is nothing but the name, labels, and now, annotations.

02:13.260 --> 02:17.640
Okay? So entire this Kubernetes Ingress manifest

02:17.640 --> 02:20.820
most of the stuff we deal with annotations only.

02:20.820 --> 02:21.720
So that's the reason

02:21.720 --> 02:24.840
we'll have one more section called "annotations".

02:24.840 --> 02:26.190
And under the spec,

02:26.190 --> 02:30.000
we'll start defining our core load balancer functionality,

02:30.000 --> 02:32.850
which is nothing but rules, right?

02:32.850 --> 02:36.690
So means like for "/star" where it should go,

02:36.690 --> 02:39.180
which target it need to associate.

02:39.180 --> 02:41.820
Or for "/app1", which target it need to associate

02:41.820 --> 02:44.190
all we'll define under "spec".

02:44.190 --> 02:46.980
So first thing is let's come back to annotations

02:46.980 --> 02:50.160
and then define the Ingress core annotations.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.680
So what are Ingress core annotations?

02:52.680 --> 02:56.010
Under annotations, we'll have two Ingress core annotations.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.380
One is "Ingress class",

02:58.380 --> 03:01.560
and the other is "Ingress scheme", right?

03:01.560 --> 03:03.630
Scheme, you know that it is nothing but

03:03.630 --> 03:06.270
internet facing our internal. Okay?

03:06.270 --> 03:08.797
So that one we are going to add, and one more is

03:08.797 --> 03:10.833
"Ingress class". Ingress class is ALB.

03:12.420 --> 03:15.120
So let's go back here for the documentation

03:15.120 --> 03:17.760
and then take these things from a sample.

03:17.760 --> 03:20.238
So these two things we need it.

03:20.238 --> 03:21.071
(typing) Okay?

03:21.071 --> 03:23.820
So let me place them here.

03:23.820 --> 03:26.580
So which is nothing but Ingress class is ALB,

03:26.580 --> 03:30.330
and then Ingress scheme is internet facing load balancer,

03:30.330 --> 03:32.160
we are going to create.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.990
In addition to that, there will be a set of

03:33.990 --> 03:35.400
health check settings,

03:35.400 --> 03:39.690
and it's equal and annotations will be available here.

03:39.690 --> 03:42.360
I gathered all together and then put it aside.

03:42.360 --> 03:44.970
So we'll get those things in then paste it here.

03:44.970 --> 03:48.270
So we'll add all our health check settings here.

03:48.270 --> 03:49.250
Okay?

03:49.250 --> 03:50.083
(typing)

03:50.083 --> 03:52.350
So let me say health check protocol is http,

03:52.350 --> 03:55.230
the traffic port, which is 8 0 9 5, we are going to use,

03:55.230 --> 03:57.210
or whatever the traffic port might be,

03:57.210 --> 03:59.970
based on the worker node, whatever it provides, right?

03:59.970 --> 04:02.130
So worker node note port ip.

04:02.130 --> 04:05.520
And so that's the reason we gave it as traffic port

04:05.520 --> 04:07.200
as usual, standard setting.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.797
And then health check path is going to be

04:08.797 --> 04:11.010
"user mgmt health status".

04:11.010 --> 04:12.720
And these are some standard interval

04:12.720 --> 04:13.920
and then timeout settings.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.320
And then success code we have given us 200.

04:16.320 --> 04:19.110
So all these annotations we have picked it from here,

04:19.110 --> 04:22.170
related to health check, whatever the annotations are there.

04:22.170 --> 04:24.330
All those things we have picked it here,

04:24.330 --> 04:27.420
and then grouped them together and then put it here.

04:27.420 --> 04:31.740
So finally one thing we need to write now is the spec. Okay?

04:31.740 --> 04:34.650
So under spec, the core thing here is the

04:34.650 --> 04:37.650
rules which we need to define, okay?

04:37.650 --> 04:39.811
So and under rules we'll have a

04:39.811 --> 04:42.120
(typing) list which is http,

04:42.120 --> 04:43.590
and under http,

04:43.590 --> 04:46.050
we are going to have something called "paths".

04:46.050 --> 04:48.900
Means like, "path of our applications". Okay?

04:48.900 --> 04:50.041
So I'll say

04:50.041 --> 04:53.130
(typing) my first path is going to be "/star".

04:53.130 --> 04:55.410
So whenever we go for next level of things,

04:55.410 --> 04:57.570
like adding additional applications.

04:57.570 --> 05:00.292
So we are going to have more number of paths here,

05:00.292 --> 05:04.590
like, /app1, and then /app2, and then /star, like that.

05:04.590 --> 05:07.740
For now we are going to say path of default/star (typing).

05:07.740 --> 05:12.000
And as usual, what is my backend here going to be, right?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.640
So under backend we need to provide two things here.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.490
So one is service name (typing). Right?

05:17.490 --> 05:18.900
And service port (typing).

05:18.900 --> 05:22.140
So which is again in our Kubernetes language only, right?

05:22.140 --> 05:25.080
So which node port service name and then service port

05:25.080 --> 05:30.060
I need to provide as backend first /star in my ALB. Right?

05:30.060 --> 05:33.210
So I can go here and then I can go to

05:33.210 --> 05:36.180
node port service and this is my node port service. Okay?

05:36.180 --> 05:39.840
So this is the name of my service name for user management.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.350
So I'll come here and then provide the service name here.

05:43.350 --> 05:46.410
And the service port is 8 0 9 5,

05:46.410 --> 05:48.270
which is going to get created.

05:48.270 --> 05:52.950
So I'm going to give 8 0 9 5. Right?

05:52.950 --> 05:54.150
So that's good.

05:54.150 --> 05:57.510
So let me close this and

05:57.510 --> 06:00.150
this is the complete Ingress manifest,

06:00.150 --> 06:02.488
whatever we have created as part of

06:02.488 --> 06:07.140
05-ALB Ingress basic. Right?

06:07.140 --> 06:08.490
So in our next lecture,

06:08.490 --> 06:11.520
we'll focus on deploying these things and then testing it.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.200
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.340
Until then, bye bye.

06:14.340 --> 06:15.173
Thank you.
