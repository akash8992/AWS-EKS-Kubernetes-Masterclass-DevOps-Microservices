WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:00.953
-: Welcome back.

00:00.953 --> 00:03.234
In the previous step we have completed the IM role

00:03.234 --> 00:06.540
IM policy and then Kubernetes service account.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.700
So now what we are going to do is we are going to

00:08.700 --> 00:11.842
update the external DS Kubernetes manifest.

00:11.842 --> 00:13.987
So the original manifest you can find

00:13.987 --> 00:18.090
in this respective link and you can always copy it

00:18.090 --> 00:21.090
and then use it as if how you want to need it.

00:21.090 --> 00:25.110
Okay, so this is the manifest letter to external DNS.

00:25.110 --> 00:28.077
Okay, so I have commented it and then used it as

00:28.077 --> 00:28.910
per our needs.

00:28.910 --> 00:31.040
So let's go ahead and then see that now.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.979
So we are going to make three changes to the original file.

00:33.979 --> 00:38.979
So let me go back to our 0 8 0 6 0 1 deploy external DNS

00:40.603 --> 00:42.240
on EKS.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.076
So you will have a cube manifest folder and

00:44.076 --> 00:48.810
inside that you'll have zero one deploy external DNS, right?

00:48.810 --> 00:51.125
So this, if you see this entire manifest, let's

00:51.125 --> 00:54.040
have a high level look on what is this manifest.

00:54.040 --> 00:56.703
Okay? So it says that create a service account

00:56.703 --> 01:00.300
with external DNS and then also

01:00.300 --> 01:01.706
it's equal and means like for this service

01:01.706 --> 01:04.261
account what all cluster roll permissions it need

01:04.261 --> 01:05.160
to have, okay?

01:05.160 --> 01:07.232
Our back roll permissions in Cuban it is, okay?

01:07.232 --> 01:09.142
So it'll have permissions to services

01:09.142 --> 01:11.940
and points and then parts with the get to watch

01:11.940 --> 01:13.375
and then list those permissions

01:13.375 --> 01:17.330
and it'll also have ingress related get watch and then list

01:17.330 --> 01:19.320
and like this.

01:19.320 --> 01:22.680
Now we are going to bind this respective cluster roll

01:22.680 --> 01:26.730
external DNS and then service account external

01:26.730 --> 01:28.800
DNS using cluster roll binding.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.270
So you can see it here.

01:30.270 --> 01:33.240
So cluster roll is external DNS role reference

01:33.240 --> 01:35.580
and then subject is service account external DNS.

01:35.580 --> 01:37.606
So we bind at using cluster roll binding.

01:37.606 --> 01:41.640
So this is a pretty straightforward manifest related to

01:41.640 --> 01:42.817
deploy external DNS.

01:42.817 --> 01:45.763
And so the RBack related stuff is completed

01:45.763 --> 01:49.004
our standard deployment stuff comes into the picture.

01:49.004 --> 01:53.730
So deployment template will have a strategy primarily.

01:53.730 --> 01:55.779
So default is rolling, update strategy

01:55.779 --> 01:59.854
and in exclusive cases we are going to use recreate.

01:59.854 --> 02:02.130
Okay? So that is the thing

02:02.130 --> 02:04.590
so delete that part and then recreate that part.

02:04.590 --> 02:07.320
Okay? So that is the story in exclusive cases.

02:07.320 --> 02:09.720
Okay, so now we are using the strategy recreate

02:09.720 --> 02:12.480
and selector is going to be match level external DNS

02:12.480 --> 02:13.313
which is same

02:13.313 --> 02:16.350
as whatever the port related metadata information.

02:16.350 --> 02:17.835
Okay? So now selector is over.

02:17.835 --> 02:19.590
The next thing is template

02:19.590 --> 02:21.330
which is nothing but the port template

02:21.330 --> 02:23.086
and inside that you'll have metadata labels

02:23.086 --> 02:26.910
and then label name of our respective pod.

02:26.910 --> 02:28.929
Okay? So in template two things

02:28.929 --> 02:30.105
metadata and spec we will have

02:30.105 --> 02:32.940
and spec we will have our existing means

02:32.940 --> 02:35.593
like our pod related manifest, right?

02:35.593 --> 02:38.100
So first thing is service account.

02:38.100 --> 02:40.823
This pod will have a service account named external DNS.

02:40.823 --> 02:45.420
So it's in it's authorization is restricted

02:45.420 --> 02:49.294
inside Kubernetes and external documented AWS services based

02:49.294 --> 02:51.426
on permissions, whatever we have provided

02:51.426 --> 02:53.820
for this external DNS service account.

02:53.820 --> 02:56.040
Okay? And containers, it said that name

02:56.040 --> 02:59.017
of the container is external DNS and the image it is taking

02:59.017 --> 03:01.067
from some of the external site, okay?

03:01.067 --> 03:03.690
Which is registry dot opensource dot all port

03:03.690 --> 03:05.700
and then external DNS latest.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.386
Okay? And these are the arguments we are going to provide

03:08.386 --> 03:11.974
to this external DNS container, right?

03:11.974 --> 03:13.294
So what are those?

03:13.294 --> 03:15.021
So primarily we need to focus

03:15.021 --> 03:17.430
on two things which we have commented.

03:17.430 --> 03:19.080
Okay? So the source says service

03:19.080 --> 03:20.832
and then source says ingress, right?

03:20.832 --> 03:23.209
So now what we are trying to tell here is we

03:23.209 --> 03:24.571
have commented two things here.

03:24.571 --> 03:25.680
What are those?

03:25.680 --> 03:29.580
Okay, so one is domain filter, okay?

03:29.580 --> 03:31.914
External DNS dot myar dot com.

03:31.914 --> 03:34.560
Okay? So we'll make external DNS C only

03:34.560 --> 03:36.686
on the hostage matching this value.

03:36.686 --> 03:39.549
Okay? So we commented this out because I really

03:39.549 --> 03:43.680
don't want to specifically allow external DNS means

03:43.680 --> 03:46.110
like I can just say Q one cloud dot com here

03:46.110 --> 03:47.847
so that it'll only match

03:47.847 --> 03:51.240
to the entries related to Q one cloud dot com.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.400
Okay? But I am leaving it open

03:53.400 --> 03:55.952
so that whatever we want we can modify

03:55.952 --> 03:58.077
in our entire space, right?

03:58.077 --> 03:59.670
So that is one thing

03:59.670 --> 04:02.212
one is domain filter and second is policy.

04:02.212 --> 04:03.470
So up certainly.

04:03.470 --> 04:04.975
So if you enable this option

04:04.975 --> 04:09.262
it would prevent the external DNS from deleting any records.

04:09.262 --> 04:11.880
So usually whenever we are testing it

04:11.880 --> 04:12.911
or whenever we are doing it, right?

04:12.911 --> 04:14.910
So what happens is like

04:14.910 --> 04:16.830
in production you can enable this feature

04:16.830 --> 04:21.690
so that no DNS entries once created will get deleted.

04:21.690 --> 04:23.820
But for us, whenever we are deploying testing

04:23.820 --> 04:26.889
and then again removing the manifest, obviously

04:26.889 --> 04:30.390
those entries in the entries need to be deleted, right?

04:30.390 --> 04:32.730
So for that purpose I commented this option.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.618
So this, if you enable it, it'll

04:34.618 --> 04:38.146
it would prevent us from external res deleting any records.

04:38.146 --> 04:40.198
So in the record sets of route 53.

04:40.198 --> 04:41.181
So it'll allow us

04:41.181 --> 04:44.880
to not to delete anything, whatever it has created, okay?

04:44.880 --> 04:49.880
So we can go back here to route 53, right?

04:50.940 --> 04:54.563
And any entries created inside that respect you hosted zone

04:54.563 --> 04:57.840
as part of this external DNS.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.798
Also, it'll not allow us to delete them.

04:59.798 --> 05:03.600
So if you go inside, so if it creates anything here

05:03.600 --> 05:06.720
those things will not get deleted if you enable this option.

05:06.720 --> 05:07.830
So I really don't need it.

05:07.830 --> 05:10.470
So these two things we have commented and one change

05:10.470 --> 05:13.472
what we need to do additionally is finally this one, okay?

05:13.472 --> 05:16.856
So already a service account is created ideally

05:16.856 --> 05:18.510
in this template.

05:18.510 --> 05:20.258
This is not required in general, okay?

05:20.258 --> 05:21.660
But whatever they say it

05:21.660 --> 05:24.390
whatever they have provided a standard template

05:24.390 --> 05:27.105
why we want to change it to different ways, right?

05:27.105 --> 05:30.651
So that's the reason we really don't need to change it.

05:30.651 --> 05:34.050
So what happens is for external DNS service account,

05:34.050 --> 05:36.021
we already seen that it is annotated with the,

05:36.021 --> 05:39.840
it is annotated with the role,

05:39.840 --> 05:42.930
whatever it is provided, right?

05:42.930 --> 05:45.390
IM role AWS, IM role, okay?

05:45.390 --> 05:46.223
The same thing.

05:46.223 --> 05:47.610
You need to provide it here one more time.

05:47.610 --> 05:48.443
That's all.

05:48.443 --> 05:50.370
Okay, so let's go back to here

05:50.370 --> 05:55.233
and go back to our cloud formation, right?

05:56.850 --> 06:00.000
So this is the one right rule already we have put this open

06:00.000 --> 06:02.670
okay? So this is the one which has the all external update.

06:02.670 --> 06:07.410
So I'm going to copy this AR and and then paste it here.

06:07.410 --> 06:11.370
So only one change primarily you need to do

06:11.370 --> 06:14.760
for this template directly if you use from this course

06:14.760 --> 06:19.020
but if you directly download from the URL, so then this one

06:19.020 --> 06:22.410
and farthest demo things to work, then we will also ensure

06:22.410 --> 06:27.410
that this line's 65 and then 67 also get commented.

06:27.780 --> 06:28.770
So that's the thing

06:28.770 --> 06:30.570
if you use this template, there is no issue.

06:30.570 --> 06:31.710
Those two are already there.

06:31.710 --> 06:35.070
Only you need to update your role from your account, right?

06:35.070 --> 06:36.450
This information.

06:36.450 --> 06:37.680
So that's about it.

06:37.680 --> 06:42.680
So now let's go back to our browser, right?

06:42.840 --> 06:46.950
And we have completed this IM role update successfully

06:46.950 --> 06:50.807
and we have ensured that 55 and 56 command these lines.

06:50.807 --> 06:53.430
Okay? So why we need to comment these lines.

06:53.430 --> 06:55.690
This also we need to discuss, okay, so if you

06:55.690 --> 07:00.690
are using K IM or cube to IM to create your IM roles.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.737
So then these things, okay?

07:02.737 --> 07:05.523
But we created our IM role

07:05.523 --> 07:09.900
IM policy and then service accounts with the EKS ctl.

07:09.900 --> 07:12.744
So this thing no need to be enabled.

07:12.744 --> 07:15.629
So those will be in the commented state only.

07:15.629 --> 07:17.640
Okay? So that's about it.

07:17.640 --> 07:21.150
And line 65 and 67 we discussed about these things

07:21.150 --> 07:23.250
exclusively. So this is good.

07:23.250 --> 07:26.340
So finally we are going to deploy this send, then verify it.

07:26.340 --> 07:28.380
Okay, so cube CTL apply.

07:28.380 --> 07:30.960
So we need to go to those respective folders.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.340
So I'm going to say zero eight

07:32.340 --> 07:35.179
which is ERB application load balances and 0 8

07:35.179 --> 07:39.180
0 6 will be ALB ingress, external DNS.

07:39.180 --> 07:43.782
Okay? So I'm going to say Q CTL apply hyphen F cube manifest

07:43.782 --> 07:47.250
right? So what happened inside that two folders

07:47.250 --> 07:52.250
will be there 0 8 0 6 0 1, which is deploy external DNS N.

07:53.229 --> 07:56.927
Okay? So now inside this Q CTL

07:56.927 --> 08:00.003
apply hyphen F cube manifests.

08:01.950 --> 08:03.723
So let this get created.

08:06.150 --> 08:07.080
That's fine.

08:07.080 --> 08:10.885
Okay, so now once this is created we are going to

08:10.885 --> 08:12.840
verify the logs.

08:12.840 --> 08:16.680
Okay? So before that, if you want we can say cube

08:16.680 --> 08:19.470
CTL get ports, it is going to get created in the default

08:19.470 --> 08:21.450
name space only it is running.

08:21.450 --> 08:25.053
So we can even verify the logs with the logs command, right?

08:26.100 --> 08:28.358
So all records are already up to date, there is

08:28.358 --> 08:33.358
no other errors related to access permission.

08:34.020 --> 08:36.840
So okay, access denied our access, forbidden nothing

08:36.840 --> 08:38.670
related to that as far as possible.

08:38.670 --> 08:40.290
Okay? So we'll see later what happens.

08:40.290 --> 08:42.570
Okay, for now it is no issues.

08:42.570 --> 08:46.418
Okay, so I'll see, I'll close this and this complete

08:46.418 --> 08:49.980
our external DNS related deployment.

08:49.980 --> 08:51.467
In our next lecture we'll apply this to our

08:51.467 --> 08:54.780
application. So one thing important here

08:54.780 --> 08:56.400
is these reference links, okay?

08:56.400 --> 08:57.725
Two reference links I have provided.

08:57.725 --> 09:00.393
So if you need additional information

09:00.393 --> 09:04.860
about this external DNS so you can use this information.

09:04.860 --> 09:09.860
Okay? So AWS are directly publishes this respected tool

09:09.870 --> 09:11.670
like external DNS they're supporting

09:11.670 --> 09:13.230
but currently in all first stage, but they

09:13.230 --> 09:15.180
they're supporting in their documentation too.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.709
Okay? So I am closing this and

09:17.709 --> 09:20.820
in our next lecture we'll focus on applying it.

09:20.820 --> 09:21.866
Okay? I'll see you in the next lecture.

09:21.866 --> 09:22.871
Until then, bye bye.

09:22.871 --> 09:23.793
Thank you.
