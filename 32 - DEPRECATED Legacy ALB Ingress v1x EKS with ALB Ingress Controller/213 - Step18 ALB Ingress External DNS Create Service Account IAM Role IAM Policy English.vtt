00:00.300 --> 00:01.133
-: Welcome back.

00:01.133 --> 00:04.740
In this lecture we are going to create the IAM policy.

00:04.740 --> 00:08.100
So this IAM policy will external DNS port

00:08.100 --> 00:10.140
to add, remove DNS entries,

00:10.140 --> 00:12.120
which is nothing but record sets in a

00:12.120 --> 00:16.200
hosted zone in AWS route 53 service, okay.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.530
So let's go ahead and then add the IAM policy.

00:19.530 --> 00:22.080
So the IAM policy we are going to put the name as

00:22.080 --> 00:25.050
allow external DNS updates.

00:25.050 --> 00:27.930
So this is the IAM policy which we are going to add

00:27.930 --> 00:30.060
and it's information is nothing but

00:30.060 --> 00:33.270
change resource record sets allow inside hosted zones

00:33.270 --> 00:34.890
for all the hosted zones

00:34.890 --> 00:36.210
and also list hosted zones

00:36.210 --> 00:39.690
and then list resource record sets.

00:39.690 --> 00:43.740
Okay, so now let's go back to our management console

00:43.740 --> 00:46.390
and go to IAM

00:50.310 --> 00:52.840
and we will go to policies

00:54.150 --> 00:56.730
and in policies we'll click on create policy

00:56.730 --> 01:01.620
and we'll go to json tab, remove whatever is there here

01:01.620 --> 01:05.760
and copy our entire json whatever is present here, okay?

01:05.760 --> 01:09.720
So, let me copy this and paste it

01:09.720 --> 01:13.410
and go to visual editor so it'll validate everything.

01:13.410 --> 01:16.560
So these are the actions we have provided in Route 53.

01:16.560 --> 01:19.260
One action related to change resource record sets.

01:19.260 --> 01:21.450
and one more here, two more here.

01:21.450 --> 01:24.660
So Route 53, in actions it is saying that

01:24.660 --> 01:27.990
list hosted zones and then list resource record sets.

01:27.990 --> 01:31.350
So one is a right and then to one list related, okay?

01:31.350 --> 01:33.180
So I'll click on review policy

01:33.180 --> 01:35.880
and provide the name for the same

01:35.880 --> 01:40.880
so which is nothing but allow external DNS updates, okay?

01:41.160 --> 01:45.750
And the next is allow access to Route 53 resources

01:45.750 --> 01:47.970
for external DNS port, okay?

01:47.970 --> 01:49.440
So this is the description.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.920
So I'll create the policy

01:53.190 --> 01:56.970
and we need to make a note of the ARN, okay?

01:56.970 --> 02:01.970
So I'll say allow external DNS updates

02:02.040 --> 02:03.960
and then I'll leave this screen like this,

02:03.960 --> 02:07.290
so that we can leverage this policy ARN

02:07.290 --> 02:09.600
whenever it is required, okay?

02:09.600 --> 02:13.500
So now the next thing is to create IAM role

02:13.500 --> 02:16.170
k8 service account, kubernetes Service account

02:16.170 --> 02:19.140
and associate IAM policy to them, okay?

02:19.140 --> 02:21.630
So as part of this step what we are going to do is

02:21.630 --> 02:25.350
we are going to create a service account IAM role

02:25.350 --> 02:28.770
and then service account in kubernetes

02:28.770 --> 02:32.040
and then IAM role in AWS IAM

02:32.040 --> 02:36.000
and then associate the allow external DNS updates policy,

02:36.000 --> 02:38.970
what we created to the IAM role, okay?

02:38.970 --> 02:40.680
So this is going to be the command

02:40.680 --> 02:42.840
which we are going to execute for the same.

02:42.840 --> 02:46.650
So I'll copy this and I'll go to my visual studio code

02:46.650 --> 02:49.590
I'll save file, new file here.

02:49.590 --> 02:51.700
And so the

02:53.760 --> 02:58.350
Kubernetes service second name is going to be external-DNS.

02:58.350 --> 03:02.520
Inside the cluster EKS demo one, in namespace default, okay?

03:02.520 --> 03:05.460
And policy ARN means like what is the IAM policy

03:05.460 --> 03:07.560
I'm going to associate here.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.270
Let's get that now.

03:09.270 --> 03:11.790
Okay, so this is the one we are going to associate.

03:11.790 --> 03:16.410
So let me remove this and add whatever we want, Okay?

03:16.410 --> 03:17.640
Created, Okay?

03:17.640 --> 03:21.120
So let's go ahead and then create it now.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.870
So let me come back to our terminal

03:24.720 --> 03:26.133
and let me paste it.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.020
So once this is created

03:31.020 --> 03:34.680
we are going to perform the verification steps, Okay?

03:34.680 --> 03:35.940
So the first thing is whether

03:35.940 --> 03:38.070
external DNS account got created.

03:38.070 --> 03:41.280
Kubectl get sa external-dns, okay?

03:41.280 --> 03:44.100
So it, it is going to create a cloud formation stack.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.890
So which will eventually create the IAM role

03:46.890 --> 03:48.420
whatever it is required.

03:48.420 --> 03:50.790
So we are going to verify those things also.

03:50.790 --> 03:54.690
So let the cloud formation stack get created.

03:54.690 --> 03:57.620
So now this got created, so let me say clear

03:57.620 --> 04:00.870
and then kubectl get service account,

04:00.870 --> 04:04.050
which is nothing but SA and whose name is

04:04.050 --> 04:06.813
external-dns, Okay?

04:08.070 --> 04:10.860
So ideally it should get created now.

04:10.860 --> 04:14.100
So if you want we can even say kubectl

04:14.100 --> 04:19.100
describe external describe service account SA

04:19.650 --> 04:24.240
and whose name is external-dns, right?

04:24.240 --> 04:26.910
And if you see in its annotations

04:26.910 --> 04:31.080
you can find the annotation related to our IAM role

04:31.080 --> 04:33.390
whatever it has created automatically.

04:33.390 --> 04:35.790
So this is the role it has created automatically.

04:35.790 --> 04:37.980
EKSCTL EKS demo 1.

04:37.980 --> 04:39.510
This is the role.

04:39.510 --> 04:41.220
So now the next step is to go ahead

04:41.220 --> 04:44.610
and then verify our cloud formation stack, right?

04:44.610 --> 04:47.410
So I'll go here to cloud formation

04:48.870 --> 04:52.200
and mostly the new cloud formation stack created just now

04:52.200 --> 04:54.300
right around 9:31.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.460
So I'll click on that

04:56.460 --> 05:00.000
and if I go inside the resources here, right

05:00.000 --> 05:02.820
so you can see the roll whatever it got created.

05:02.820 --> 05:07.170
So it started with 1QH and then 50 at the end, Okay.

05:07.170 --> 05:09.960
So you can see it here, 1QH and then 50.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.570
So the same role is annotated for the

05:12.570 --> 05:14.550
Kubernetes service account.

05:14.550 --> 05:15.930
So I can click on this

05:15.930 --> 05:18.960
and then get the role information here.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.820
So in the permissions tabs you can see that

05:20.820 --> 05:24.750
whatever the all external DNS updates related policy

05:24.750 --> 05:26.100
we have created,

05:26.100 --> 05:28.740
it got associated with this role.

05:28.740 --> 05:30.750
So now the next thing is

05:30.750 --> 05:33.180
we have verified everything, cloud formation stack

05:33.180 --> 05:36.300
and then we have verified IAM role and then IAM policy.

05:36.300 --> 05:38.190
So let's make a note of this.

05:38.190 --> 05:41.190
IAM role here, so which is nothing but role ARN

05:41.190 --> 05:44.160
and why because in our next step

05:44.160 --> 05:47.310
we are going to use that to update the

05:47.310 --> 05:51.210
external DNS deployment manifest, Okay?

05:51.210 --> 05:52.890
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

05:52.890 --> 05:54.090
Until then, bye bye.

05:54.090 --> 05:54.923
Thank you.
