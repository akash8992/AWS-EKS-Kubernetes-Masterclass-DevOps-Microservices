00:00.150 --> 00:00.990
-: Welcome back.

00:00.990 --> 00:01.980
In this lecture

00:01.980 --> 00:05.370
we are going to understand about ingress SSL

00:05.370 --> 00:08.010
nothing but the application load balances

00:08.010 --> 00:12.480
what we are going to create as part of ingress manifest

00:12.480 --> 00:15.570
so how to enable SSL using the manifest

00:15.570 --> 00:18.030
so that we are going to look into,

00:18.030 --> 00:20.430
Right? So this is the previous architecture

00:20.430 --> 00:21.840
whatever we have implemented

00:21.840 --> 00:25.230
as part of context path based routing.

00:25.230 --> 00:28.290
So now we are going to enable SSL here.

00:28.290 --> 00:30.390
So to enable SSL here,

00:30.390 --> 00:32.010
so in route 53

00:32.010 --> 00:34.710
we need to have a valid domain.

00:34.710 --> 00:36.930
So if you don't have any domain there

00:36.930 --> 00:38.940
so we can go ahead and then register.

00:38.940 --> 00:39.960
So we are anyway going

00:39.960 --> 00:44.220
to register a new domain here Cubeoncloud.com.

00:44.220 --> 00:47.490
So we are going to see even how to register a domain

00:47.490 --> 00:49.530
and then how much time it takes to register

00:49.530 --> 00:51.630
and then how we are going to make the payment.

00:51.630 --> 00:52.770
All those stuff

00:52.770 --> 00:56.400
using the cloud 53 register a domain option.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.500
So I already have stacksimplify.com

00:58.500 --> 01:01.470
but it is already used for my live website

01:01.470 --> 01:03.210
so I really don't want to disturb that.

01:03.210 --> 01:05.430
So we are going to create a new registered domain

01:05.430 --> 01:08.460
which is cubeoncloud.com.

01:08.460 --> 01:09.750
So now on route 53,

01:09.750 --> 01:11.400
we are going to do that part.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.580
So the next thing is once you have the domain

01:14.580 --> 01:17.980
so you need to go to the certificate manager in AWS

01:18.840 --> 01:21.090
and then register a certificate.

01:21.090 --> 01:24.960
So here we can register with sub domains, the certificates

01:24.960 --> 01:27.030
or we can create a complete name

01:27.030 --> 01:29.417
which is star dot cubeoncloud.com.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.582
So we are going to register star dot cube

01:32.582 --> 01:33.840
on cubeoncloud.com,

01:33.840 --> 01:36.870
which will help us in upcoming lectures,

01:36.870 --> 01:39.150
which we are going to discuss about

01:39.150 --> 01:42.060
which is external DNS with cloud 53.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.110
So that's the purpose.

01:43.110 --> 01:45.640
We are going to implement star dot cubeoncloud.com

01:47.838 --> 01:49.230
SSL certificate here.

01:49.230 --> 01:50.940
So whatever maybe the sub domain

01:50.940 --> 01:53.280
this certificate will be valid.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.530
So on cubeoncloud.com.

01:55.530 --> 01:56.520
So that's about it.

01:56.520 --> 01:59.190
So once we complete the certificate step

01:59.190 --> 02:02.280
we are going to update the ingress manifest

02:02.280 --> 02:05.940
with SSL related annotations, right?

02:05.940 --> 02:08.580
So in three steps we have completed these things

02:08.580 --> 02:10.020
and then we are going to deploy

02:10.020 --> 02:12.960
and then test with both HTTP URLs

02:12.960 --> 02:15.450
and then HTTPS URLs.

02:15.450 --> 02:16.440
So in both the things

02:16.440 --> 02:19.530
it is going to work as expected, right?

02:19.530 --> 02:20.880
So which means like from HTTP

02:20.880 --> 02:22.290
it should serve the content

02:22.290 --> 02:25.710
and also HTTPS it should serve the content.

02:25.710 --> 02:29.130
In our next section, we will enable HTTP to HTTPS.

02:29.130 --> 02:31.140
That's a different section plan for us.

02:31.140 --> 02:33.568
For now, let's enable both HTTP

02:33.568 --> 02:34.680
and then HTTPS URLs

02:34.680 --> 02:39.630
for our applications hosted on kubernetes cluster

02:39.630 --> 02:42.330
Okay, so I'll see you in the next lecture.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.743
Until then, bye bye.
