00:00.000 --> 00:00.930
-: Welcome back.

00:00.930 --> 00:03.480
So let's get into our ALB ingress,

00:03.480 --> 00:05.220
SSL zero eight zero four

00:05.220 --> 00:07.980
and we have completed our step one introduction.

00:07.980 --> 00:09.000
And then step two,

00:09.000 --> 00:11.310
register a domain in Route 53.

00:11.310 --> 00:12.510
So now we are in the

00:12.510 --> 00:14.700
step three create SSL certificate

00:14.700 --> 00:15.533
in

00:15.533 --> 00:16.770
certificate manager.

00:16.770 --> 00:18.600
So let's go ahead and then

00:18.600 --> 00:21.120
do that now, right?

00:21.120 --> 00:24.360
So we'll go here and then in services we'll search

00:24.360 --> 00:26.636
for certificate manager.

00:26.636 --> 00:29.373
Right? Here In the certificate manager.

00:31.650 --> 00:35.820
And we already have a certificate related

00:35.820 --> 00:38.119
to StarDot stack simplify.com.

00:38.119 --> 00:41.010
So which we are even not using it now.

00:41.010 --> 00:42.790
So we are primarily focused

00:43.902 --> 00:47.040
on using star dot cube on cloud.com.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.050
So request a certificate

00:49.050 --> 00:52.410
request a public certificate, right?

00:52.410 --> 00:55.230
And provide our domain name, right?

00:55.230 --> 00:59.580
So our domain name, whatever need is cube on cloud.com.

00:59.580 --> 01:00.970
So we are going to give the

01:02.329 --> 01:04.440
domain name is star dot q

01:04.440 --> 01:06.480
on cloud.com.

01:06.480 --> 01:10.750
So let me provide this right and

01:11.760 --> 01:14.730
if you want to add any other names to this certificate, no

01:14.730 --> 01:16.170
we already give Star, right?

01:16.170 --> 01:17.940
So ideally we should be good.

01:17.940 --> 01:21.440
So use an star to request a wild card certificate.

01:21.440 --> 01:23.760
So which will be applicable for

01:23.760 --> 01:24.750
several sites

01:24.750 --> 01:26.580
which is nothing but any number of sites.

01:26.580 --> 01:30.360
Three W side.example.com images.example.com, like that

01:30.360 --> 01:32.760
we can use it for many stuff.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.039
So now I'll click on

01:34.039 --> 01:34.968
next

01:34.968 --> 01:37.620
and it is asking for the validation method.

01:37.620 --> 01:39.270
Do you want a DNS validation?

01:39.270 --> 01:43.740
Or a email validation? Okay, so if our choose this option

01:43.740 --> 01:46.080
if you have or obtain a permission to modify

01:46.080 --> 01:48.030
that DNS configuration on the domains

01:48.030 --> 01:49.289
which means if you have the

01:49.289 --> 01:50.280
access

01:50.280 --> 01:51.150
to your

01:51.150 --> 01:53.670
Route 53 and then with your user

01:53.670 --> 01:56.910
you are able to modify your Route 53 domains here.

01:56.910 --> 01:59.340
So then ideally not an issue, okay?

01:59.340 --> 02:01.112
So you can directly

02:01.112 --> 02:02.730
use it.

02:02.730 --> 02:04.351
So I'll do the DNS validation.

02:04.351 --> 02:08.520
So I'll click on next and any tags you want to view

02:08.520 --> 02:11.033
I really don't need to give anything review

02:11.033 --> 02:14.520
and then confirm and then request.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.923
So we are creating this SSL certificate now.

02:19.164 --> 02:20.190
So what it says is

02:20.190 --> 02:22.200
like create a senior record in the

02:22.200 --> 02:23.310
DNS configuration

02:23.310 --> 02:26.010
for each of these domains listed below.

02:26.010 --> 02:27.990
So how you can do that is just click

02:27.990 --> 02:31.530
on this and then automatically it'll provide a link here.

02:31.530 --> 02:34.020
So you really don't need to go to route 53 and do it.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.160
If you click on this link

02:35.160 --> 02:39.030
create a record in route 53, it automatically creates.

02:39.030 --> 02:41.670
So if you see on Cube on cloud.com currently

02:41.670 --> 02:43.847
only two record that is there after adding

02:43.847 --> 02:45.750
let's see how many it'll be there.

02:45.750 --> 02:47.340
Okay? So you can see here

02:47.340 --> 02:49.140
only two should be there record sets,

02:49.140 --> 02:50.359
default record sets.

02:50.359 --> 02:52.457
So now let's come to certificate manager

02:52.457 --> 02:56.080
and click on create record in route 53.

02:56.080 --> 02:58.886
Okay, so it is going to create this scene record there.

02:58.886 --> 03:01.260
Okay? So it should be created,

03:01.260 --> 03:02.710
it'll take a while to create.

03:03.780 --> 03:05.640
Okay, so it created, okay

03:05.640 --> 03:08.580
so now what happens is once it is created, we can click

03:08.580 --> 03:10.770
on continue and wait for the

03:10.770 --> 03:11.858
validation to happen.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.340
So it'll take hardly not less

03:14.340 --> 03:16.080
than means like five to 10 minutes.

03:16.080 --> 03:17.939
This validation should be completed.

03:17.939 --> 03:21.208
I'll pass the video and then once it is completed

03:21.208 --> 03:23.093
we will verify that and then

03:23.093 --> 03:25.560
move on with the next steps.

03:25.560 --> 03:26.580
So we can see it now.

03:26.580 --> 03:29.880
Star dot cube on cloud.com is issued

03:29.880 --> 03:32.520
and then ready for us for the use.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.960
So in our next step we'll focus on

03:36.090 --> 03:37.680
creating the annotations related

03:37.680 --> 03:41.910
to SSL in our alb ingre SSL dot yml.

03:41.910 --> 03:43.560
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

03:43.560 --> 03:44.910
Until then, bye bye.

03:44.910 --> 03:45.743
Thank you.
