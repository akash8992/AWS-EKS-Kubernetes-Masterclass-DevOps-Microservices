00:00.240 --> 00:01.230
-: Welcome back.

00:01.230 --> 00:03.509
In this lecture we are going to understand

00:03.509 --> 00:07.350
about ingress and then external DNS.

00:07.350 --> 00:10.140
So what is this external DNS,

00:10.140 --> 00:12.510
and then how we are going to use it.

00:12.510 --> 00:15.510
So, if you see our current architecture diagram

00:15.510 --> 00:17.790
whatever we have discussed so far.

00:17.790 --> 00:20.790
So if you see other than RDS databases

00:20.790 --> 00:23.370
and then route 53 entries remaining

00:23.370 --> 00:27.690
everything we have provisioned using Kubernetes manifest.

00:27.690 --> 00:30.720
So which means like, whatever the deployment

00:30.720 --> 00:34.110
our note port services, our application load balances,

00:34.110 --> 00:38.610
and then part paced routing, SSL and then SSL redirect.

00:38.610 --> 00:41.340
So we just created the certificate,

00:41.340 --> 00:44.340
our route 53 related register domains

00:44.340 --> 00:47.070
and then hosted Jones with the record sets.

00:47.070 --> 00:49.440
These things we have done manually.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.890
So, but certificate is a one time job that is fine.

00:52.890 --> 00:56.010
And RDS, yes means like,

00:56.010 --> 00:58.170
if we have something from Kubernetes,

00:58.170 --> 01:02.010
if we can create automatically RDS databases, that is great.

01:02.010 --> 01:02.843
Okay?

01:02.843 --> 01:03.676
But these type

01:03.676 --> 01:07.650
of explorations are currently in the initial phases.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.620
So there is something called, "K Operator."

01:10.620 --> 01:13.560
So what it does is from Kubernetes itself you'll

01:13.560 --> 01:16.020
be able to create the Dynamo DB.

01:16.020 --> 01:18.720
Okay? So they are enhancing that.

01:18.720 --> 01:19.553
And then maybe

01:19.553 --> 01:22.560
in future many of AWS services will be able to

01:22.560 --> 01:27.560
be get created using Kubernetes manifest with K Operator.

01:27.570 --> 01:31.860
But, as on today, we need to go for RDS databases manually.

01:31.860 --> 01:35.220
But, for route 53 interest, we have something called

01:35.220 --> 01:36.780
external DNS.

01:36.780 --> 01:39.270
Using that from Kubernetes manifests,

01:39.270 --> 01:40.710
using Kubernetes manifests.

01:40.710 --> 01:44.670
And then, in ingress adding the annotations related

01:44.670 --> 01:46.920
to external DNS.

01:46.920 --> 01:50.550
DNS will allow us to automatically

01:50.550 --> 01:55.440
add record sets or DNS interest in the route 53.

01:55.440 --> 01:59.100
So using this external DNS related annotations updated

01:59.100 --> 02:00.180
in the ingress.

02:00.180 --> 02:04.560
In addition to deploying the external DNS related deployment

02:04.560 --> 02:07.170
in our existing EKS cluster

02:07.170 --> 02:10.980
which will allow us to update the route 53 entries.

02:10.980 --> 02:15.180
So let's go back to our GitHub repo once

02:15.180 --> 02:17.460
and then see what we are going to do.

02:17.460 --> 02:22.460
So we are going inside 08, 06 ALB ingress, external DNS.

02:22.830 --> 02:25.380
So this is divided into primarily two parts.

02:25.380 --> 02:29.370
One is deploying the external DNS on EKS, which is nothing

02:29.370 --> 02:32.340
but it is a simple deployment with a single part related

02:32.340 --> 02:33.990
to external DNS.

02:33.990 --> 02:35.520
And, after that,

02:35.520 --> 02:38.640
applying our external DNS related annotations

02:38.640 --> 02:41.037
for our application and then testing it will be

02:41.037 --> 02:42.540
the next step. Okay?

02:42.540 --> 02:46.863
So now let's go into the 08, 06, 01.

02:48.120 --> 02:52.560
And then if you see here, as usual, if our pod

02:52.560 --> 02:55.170
inside the Kubernetes it need to access

02:55.170 --> 02:58.890
the external AWS services, it need to follow a

02:58.890 --> 03:02.520
process which is nothing but it need to have a I AM role

03:02.520 --> 03:03.870
and then I AM policy.

03:03.870 --> 03:06.960
I AM policy outlining which AWS services

03:06.960 --> 03:08.400
it needs access to.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.310
Example, it needs access to route 53. Right?

03:11.310 --> 03:13.380
So I AM policy and I AM role

03:13.380 --> 03:15.210
in addition to that a service account

03:15.210 --> 03:17.100
in Kubernetes which will be associated

03:17.100 --> 03:20.370
with this disrespect you external DNS part.

03:20.370 --> 03:22.890
And then altogether I AM role

03:22.890 --> 03:25.470
and then service account need to be associated

03:25.470 --> 03:29.790
so that the external DNS part will be able to go ahead

03:29.790 --> 03:32.070
and then add the interest in rock 53.

03:32.070 --> 03:35.730
So related those changes, whatever is required

03:35.730 --> 03:37.440
like I AM policy, I AM role,

03:37.440 --> 03:40.020
all those things will be our next steps to implement

03:40.020 --> 03:42.870
for our external DNS deployment.

03:42.870 --> 03:44.700
So I'll see you in the next lecture,

03:44.700 --> 03:46.410
and then, we'll go ahead

03:46.410 --> 03:50.340
and then implement the steps related to external DNS.

03:50.340 --> 03:51.903
Until then, bye bye. Thank you.
