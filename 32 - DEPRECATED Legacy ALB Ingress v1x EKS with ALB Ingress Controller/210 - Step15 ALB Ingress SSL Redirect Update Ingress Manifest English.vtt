00:00.180 --> 00:01.013
-: Welcome back.

00:01.013 --> 00:01.890
In this lecture,

00:01.890 --> 00:05.730
we are going to understand about Ingress SSL redirect.

00:05.730 --> 00:08.280
So, which is nothing, but, in general,

00:08.280 --> 00:10.470
whenever we are building our applications

00:10.470 --> 00:12.030
and then deploying in production,

00:12.030 --> 00:14.163
we usually have a requirement like,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.720
our http URL should be auto redirected to https.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.240
So, most generalize the requirement and then,

00:21.240 --> 00:24.210
in most of the load balances we usually do this.

00:24.210 --> 00:26.670
Okay, so this became a load balancer setting

00:26.670 --> 00:31.170
wherein if you want to read out your URL from http to https,

00:31.170 --> 00:32.520
you can do it.

00:32.520 --> 00:35.013
So, how we are going to do that in Ingress?

00:35.970 --> 00:36.960
Manifest means like,

00:36.960 --> 00:40.080
Ingress Kubernetes manifest how we are going to write it.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.000
So, we are going to look into.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.320
So, before going there,

00:43.320 --> 00:46.410
so, we also need to understand something about

00:46.410 --> 00:48.730
custom action annotations in

00:49.800 --> 00:52.410
Ingress specifically.

00:52.410 --> 00:56.330
So, let's go back to our GitHub repo and then

00:56.330 --> 00:59.247
we'll go to zero eight zero five

00:59.247 --> 01:02.400
ALB Ingress SSL redirect, right?

01:02.400 --> 01:04.260
So, inside this, we need to go to

01:04.260 --> 01:05.730
this respect to link, okay?

01:05.730 --> 01:07.290
So, which is nothing but, a reference

01:07.290 --> 01:09.330
for custom actions, okay?

01:09.330 --> 01:11.010
So, I'll open it here.

01:11.010 --> 01:13.320
So, in the annotation section, right?

01:13.320 --> 01:15.120
So, the first annotation is nothing but,

01:15.120 --> 01:17.400
the actions dot custom action name.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.830
So, the first annotation whatever you're seeing ALB

01:19.830 --> 01:24.830
Ingress given it's dot ivo actions dot custom action name

01:25.170 --> 01:26.730
whatever you can provide here.

01:26.730 --> 01:29.444
So, inside that, if you see it in a very detailed manner

01:29.444 --> 01:33.031
so, it provides a method for configuring custom actions

01:33.031 --> 01:35.809
on a listener such as for redirect actions.

01:35.809 --> 01:38.330
So, that is one important thing, and the second is the

01:38.330 --> 01:39.602
action name in the annotation

01:39.602 --> 01:42.532
must match the service naming Ingress rules and

01:42.532 --> 01:45.548
service port must be use annotation.

01:45.548 --> 01:47.630
Okay? So this one we'll come to next but,

01:47.630 --> 01:49.920
first, let's see the first point here

01:49.920 --> 01:51.269
which is provides a method

01:51.269 --> 01:54.136
for configuring custom actions on it, listener.

01:54.136 --> 01:57.116
Let's go back to over load balancer.

01:57.116 --> 01:59.730
So, we have created this load balancer

01:59.730 --> 02:02.070
as part of the previous section

02:02.070 --> 02:03.750
which is nothing but, zero eight zero four

02:05.346 --> 02:07.069
LB ingress SSL, and in

02:07.069 --> 02:09.750
this section we really didn't clean

02:09.750 --> 02:13.410
up at the end, so, we want evident cleaned up in here

02:13.410 --> 02:16.050
so, we'll, again, come back to zero eight

02:16.050 --> 02:19.800
zero five ingress SSL redirect and let's

02:19.800 --> 02:20.850
try to understand more

02:20.850 --> 02:23.070
about what is this provides the method

02:23.070 --> 02:26.130
for configuring custom actions on it, listener, right?

02:26.130 --> 02:27.330
So, what are those actions

02:27.330 --> 02:29.070
from load balances perspective first

02:29.070 --> 02:30.795
see that and then go back and then write

02:30.795 --> 02:33.251
it in the cube and notice ingress manifest.

02:33.251 --> 02:36.990
Okay? So if you see here forty-eight "R" four four three

02:36.990 --> 02:38.284
if you click on view edit rules

02:38.284 --> 02:41.490
so, there are a lot of rules, you are writing in here, okay?

02:41.490 --> 02:43.680
So, when the path is slash "F" slash "star"

02:43.680 --> 02:47.280
so, then, go to this respective target group

02:47.280 --> 02:49.493
in the same way if you take it here

02:49.493 --> 02:53.100
so, go to this respective target group is the action.

02:53.100 --> 02:56.520
So, if you want, you can insert a rule here saying that.

02:56.520 --> 02:59.467
So, when the path is slash star, right?

02:59.467 --> 03:01.950
and now, this is the action

03:01.950 --> 03:04.980
this is the custom action whatever we are discussing, right?

03:04.980 --> 03:06.270
So, when this is the case

03:06.270 --> 03:08.790
when, when it is slash star then redirect

03:08.790 --> 03:11.014
to to so and so redirect to to https

03:11.014 --> 03:13.280
or redirect to to where we want to redirect.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.460
Redirect to a different protocol, redirect

03:15.460 --> 03:17.810
to http, another URL or redirect

03:17.810 --> 03:21.180
to https with a three zero one permanently redirect.

03:21.180 --> 03:25.080
Okay? So with original host path query.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.510
So, this is the default rule, whatever is present here,

03:27.510 --> 03:28.343
okay?

03:28.343 --> 03:29.640
So, in the port, whatever you want to

03:29.640 --> 03:30.690
give four four three and

03:30.690 --> 03:33.420
if you say add, so you get this value, right?

03:33.420 --> 03:37.380
Which is nothing but to https hash host path and then

03:37.380 --> 03:38.820
query whatever is provided with their

03:38.820 --> 03:40.774
status score http three zero one.

03:40.774 --> 03:43.350
Exactly whatever we have done here

03:43.350 --> 03:46.620
on the AWS management console, we are going to

03:46.620 --> 03:50.340
write the same thing in the Kubernetes ingress manifest.

03:50.340 --> 03:53.310
That's all, and this path, whatever you have

03:53.310 --> 03:55.050
written slash star is going to

03:55.050 --> 03:57.420
be the first one in the forty eighty rules.

03:57.420 --> 03:59.640
Okay? So all these things will be ignored as soon

03:59.640 --> 04:00.630
as we write this

04:00.630 --> 04:03.480
because anything with slash star automatically

04:03.480 --> 04:05.386
it needs to redirect to https colon

04:05.386 --> 04:10.380
whatever the host came in from the browser and the path

04:10.380 --> 04:12.030
whatever came from the browser and

04:12.030 --> 04:14.220
if any query tags also up and all those things.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.800
So like this, so if once we add the send and

04:16.800 --> 04:17.760
save it automatically

04:17.760 --> 04:19.985
all these things will become invalidated.

04:19.985 --> 04:22.680
So, now, currently, we are not doing it

04:22.680 --> 04:26.730
via UI and we are going to do it via Kubernetes manifest.

04:26.730 --> 04:29.010
So, we are going to update our ingress manifest

04:29.010 --> 04:32.082
with these details and then apply it and then see

04:32.082 --> 04:34.890
that these changes takes place automatically here.

04:34.890 --> 04:36.330
So, everything we are going to update

04:36.330 --> 04:37.950
in our manifest and then do it.

04:37.950 --> 04:40.262
Okay, so now let's go back here, right?

04:40.262 --> 04:44.820
So, we'll go back and then in addition to whatever I said

04:44.820 --> 04:48.060
right that we are using it for http two https

04:48.060 --> 04:50.460
but, there will be many redirect things you need

04:50.460 --> 04:51.750
on the load balances.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.120
Like, you want to send a custom response for

04:54.120 --> 04:55.560
your five zero three error.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.460
So, you can do that.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.080
Here is the sample they have provided

04:58.080 --> 05:00.330
for how you want to do it and

05:00.330 --> 05:01.710
second, is you want to redirect

05:01.710 --> 05:03.930
to another external URL.

05:03.930 --> 05:05.640
You can do that or you can forward

05:05.640 --> 05:08.010
to a single target group or you can forward

05:08.010 --> 05:09.420
to multiple target groups.

05:09.420 --> 05:12.120
So, all these things are already available here and

05:12.120 --> 05:13.170
how much you want to do

05:13.170 --> 05:14.790
and all those things like, example,

05:14.790 --> 05:18.150
like, you can take the path this one and then

05:18.150 --> 05:19.956
add action and then forward to

05:19.956 --> 05:22.500
so, which target group and how much percent,

05:22.500 --> 05:25.560
ten percent of the traffic and this target group and

05:25.560 --> 05:26.550
remaining ninety percent

05:26.550 --> 05:31.410
of the traffic for slash KBC star, something like that.

05:31.410 --> 05:34.333
Okay? So all these things are doable, via UI and

05:34.333 --> 05:36.720
now, all these things we will be able to do

05:36.720 --> 05:38.070
via Kubernetes manifests.

05:38.070 --> 05:40.680
Okay? So that's what I'm trying to explain.

05:40.680 --> 05:44.910
So, now, here if we go back to this one

05:44.910 --> 05:46.500
so, this part we have cleared out

05:46.500 --> 05:50.010
what is it by seeing it at the screen.

05:50.010 --> 05:53.040
Okay, it means like AWS management console alb screens.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.006
Okay? Now, what is this part?

05:55.006 --> 05:57.480
So, the action name, whatever you provide

05:57.480 --> 05:59.597
in the annotation must match the service name

05:59.597 --> 06:01.020
in the Ingress rule and

06:01.020 --> 06:04.165
service port must have use annotation compulsory.

06:04.165 --> 06:07.920
So, let's go ahead and then see our manifest and

06:07.920 --> 06:11.424
then, get that understanding little bit, right?

06:11.424 --> 06:14.680
So, let's go back here

06:16.680 --> 06:17.513
and

06:18.420 --> 06:19.253
we will

06:20.160 --> 06:22.680
we'll close my read me file here and then we'll go

06:22.680 --> 06:25.560
to zero eight zero five ALB ingress SSL

06:25.560 --> 06:27.360
redirect and this is the one.

06:27.360 --> 06:30.990
So, now let's see, the first thing is SSL redirect setting.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.875
So, let's go ahead and then understand that first.

06:33.875 --> 06:37.620
So, in our manifest we are supposed to make two changes

06:37.620 --> 06:40.080
one is are the custom action annotation based

06:40.080 --> 06:41.760
on whatever we have provided.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.400
So, I have added ALB, Ingress, whatever the Kubernetes

06:44.400 --> 06:47.340
dot actions dot whatever the name you want to give.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.560
You can give the action name here I give SSL

06:49.560 --> 06:52.561
hyphen redirect and I provided the JSUN file

06:52.561 --> 06:54.390
with the standard syntax saying

06:54.390 --> 06:56.929
that the type is going to be redirect, and the

06:56.929 --> 07:00.810
redirect config is going to be https protocol and

07:00.810 --> 07:02.783
port is four four three and the status score

07:02.783 --> 07:05.340
for the redirect is going to be http

07:05.340 --> 07:06.510
underscore three zero one,

07:06.510 --> 07:08.610
the same thing I have provided here.

07:08.610 --> 07:11.070
So, this is change one and change two

07:11.070 --> 07:13.440
relates to what we have discussed here.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.420
Okay? So which is nothing but the action name

07:15.420 --> 07:17.970
in the annotation must match the service name.

07:17.970 --> 07:20.760
So, as we told in port eighty rule,

07:20.760 --> 07:23.220
the first rule should be slash star for this, correct?

07:23.220 --> 07:25.650
Right? So path is equal to slash star and

07:25.650 --> 07:28.500
the back end with service name and service port.

07:28.500 --> 07:31.950
So, service name should be always the action name,

07:31.950 --> 07:33.420
whatever you have given here

07:33.420 --> 07:36.360
which is nothing but, SSL redirect, right?

07:36.360 --> 07:39.330
And the service port is going to be use annotation

07:39.330 --> 07:41.515
the same thing, whatever we have discussed here.

07:41.515 --> 07:45.060
So, service name is going to be the action name

07:45.060 --> 07:47.190
which is nothing, but SSL redirect and

07:47.190 --> 07:49.860
service port is going to be use annotation,

07:49.860 --> 07:52.680
the same thing we have defined here.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.680
So, once we make these two changes from the template,

07:55.680 --> 07:59.344
whatever we took from zero to zero eight four which is zero

07:59.344 --> 08:03.597
seven "L" being SSL, just add these two changes which is

08:03.597 --> 08:06.926
SSL redirect setting and one more is path related

08:06.926 --> 08:09.180
SSL redirect setting, and then

08:09.180 --> 08:11.790
once we apply these things automatically

08:11.790 --> 08:15.660
what happens is all the rules present here, right?

08:15.660 --> 08:18.240
All these rules will go away and then whatever the rule

08:18.240 --> 08:19.073
we have seen, right?

08:19.073 --> 08:23.203
Whenever it is slash star then redirected to http colon host

08:23.203 --> 08:27.440
and then colon four four three port slash path, dollar path

08:27.440 --> 08:31.230
and then again query question mark and then query.

08:31.230 --> 08:34.440
So, like, that it is going to auto create all those things.

08:34.440 --> 08:39.090
So, now we have completed this step related to it, okay?

08:39.090 --> 08:41.640
So, now we'll go ahead and then deploy all the manifests

08:41.640 --> 08:42.690
in our next lecture.

08:42.690 --> 08:46.020
So, after implementing this, what is going to happen?

08:46.020 --> 08:47.820
So, that's another important thing, right?

08:47.820 --> 08:49.937
So, http two https, it is going to redirect,

08:49.937 --> 08:51.780
so, let's see that, also.

08:51.780 --> 08:55.011
So, this is our current architecture, whatever we have seen,

08:55.011 --> 08:57.270
as part of previous section

08:57.270 --> 09:00.431
which is Ingress SSL and then the

09:00.431 --> 09:03.510
context part based routing and all those things.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.820
So, now, what happens whenever you implement this

09:05.820 --> 09:09.960
SSL redirect is so SSL redirect related changes

09:09.960 --> 09:11.880
we will be updating in our Ingress.

09:11.880 --> 09:12.810
Those are two changes,

09:12.810 --> 09:15.570
whatever we just now discussed, and then,

09:15.570 --> 09:18.750
what happens is whenever you access any http URL

09:18.750 --> 09:21.331
automatically browser will redirect

09:21.331 --> 09:23.130
to https URL, okay?

09:23.130 --> 09:25.230
So, that's what is going to happen now.

09:25.230 --> 09:28.380
So, let's go ahead and then deploy and then test it now.

09:28.380 --> 09:29.910
So, I'll see you in the next lecture.

09:29.910 --> 09:30.930
Until then, bye bye.

09:30.930 --> 09:31.763
Thank you.
