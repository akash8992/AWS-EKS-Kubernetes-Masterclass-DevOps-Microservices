00:00.000 --> 00:00.833
-: Welcome back.

00:00.833 --> 00:02.070
In the previous lecture,

00:02.070 --> 00:05.370
we have understood about context path based routing

00:05.370 --> 00:08.430
in ingress in a architectural manner.

00:08.430 --> 00:11.490
So now we are going to create two more applications for us,

00:11.490 --> 00:15.360
which we are going to deploy as part of this demo, right?

00:15.360 --> 00:18.030
So we are going to create Nginx App1

00:18.030 --> 00:19.800
and then App2 Deployment,

00:19.800 --> 00:21.180
and then Service.

00:21.180 --> 00:24.300
So both deployment and then its equal in NodePort service,

00:24.300 --> 00:26.710
we are going to create in a single YAML file

00:27.600 --> 00:28.433
per application.

00:28.433 --> 00:29.773
So for App1 Nginx,

00:29.773 --> 00:33.630
05-Nginx-App1-Deployment-and-NodePortService.

00:33.630 --> 00:36.720
And for App2 Nginx, it is going to be 06.

00:36.720 --> 00:40.350
So these are regular deployment in NodePort services,

00:40.350 --> 00:42.870
whatever we have implemented so far, right?

00:42.870 --> 00:44.940
So we really don't need to write one more time

00:44.940 --> 00:47.070
a live template for these things, okay?

00:47.070 --> 00:49.200
So that's the reason I have written them

00:49.200 --> 00:50.910
and then put it right here.

00:50.910 --> 00:55.470
So this is the 08-03-ALB-Ingress-ContextPath-Based-Routing

00:55.470 --> 00:57.870
inside the kube-manifests folder.

00:57.870 --> 01:01.238
And inside that, you can see MySQL-externalName,

01:01.238 --> 01:03.598
UserManagementMicroservice, Kubernetes-Secrets,

01:03.598 --> 01:05.100
UserManagement-NodePort-Service.

01:05.100 --> 01:08.580
After that, you get 05-Nginx-App1, right?

01:08.580 --> 01:10.680
So its deployment is here.

01:10.680 --> 01:13.650
So standard apps/v1 will be the apiVersion.

01:13.650 --> 01:14.610
And the name...

01:14.610 --> 01:16.410
So all those things are as usual, okay?

01:16.410 --> 01:18.480
Spec will have, in general, for deployments,

01:18.480 --> 01:21.570
replicas, selectors, and then pod template, right?

01:21.570 --> 01:22.980
So 1 replica.

01:22.980 --> 01:25.110
And then in matchLabels,

01:25.110 --> 01:26.520
as usual, we know that we are going

01:26.520 --> 01:28.800
to have the same value in matchLabels.

01:28.800 --> 01:29.850
So whatever is there,

01:29.850 --> 01:32.310
the same value will be there in pod template,

01:32.310 --> 01:34.500
metadata labels also.

01:34.500 --> 01:37.710
Finally, the pod spec will have the containers,

01:37.710 --> 01:38.820
and inside that container,

01:38.820 --> 01:41.010
my first container is app1-nginx.

01:41.010 --> 01:42.360
And then I'm bringing that

01:42.360 --> 01:47.360
from my stacksimplify/kube-nginxapp1 and 1.0.0 version.

01:48.840 --> 01:50.460
And now, for this deployment,

01:50.460 --> 01:52.500
you want to expose it as a NodePort service,

01:52.500 --> 01:54.750
which we have done for multiple times.

01:54.750 --> 01:56.700
So as usual, it is NodePort.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.990
And then port is 80.

01:57.990 --> 01:59.790
And then targetPort is 80. That's all.

01:59.790 --> 02:01.650
We really don't need to mention any NodePort

02:01.650 --> 02:04.980
because it is going to dynamically take that value.

02:04.980 --> 02:07.410
So now one important thing here is annotations

02:07.410 --> 02:10.500
I have written here, right, in this level.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.110
So we'll come back to this in our next step.

02:13.110 --> 02:15.900
Whatever we have written for our app1,

02:15.900 --> 02:17.040
we have copy-pasted,

02:17.040 --> 02:20.850
and then just changed it to app2 here, okay?

02:20.850 --> 02:22.890
So we'll discuss about this health check path

02:22.890 --> 02:24.003
annotation later.

02:25.320 --> 02:26.550
So now let's move on

02:26.550 --> 02:30.000
to 07-ALB-Ingress-ContextPath-Based-Routing.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.560
So here comes our real work,

02:31.560 --> 02:33.750
which we need to do from YAML perspective

02:33.750 --> 02:35.430
to our manifest perspective.

02:35.430 --> 02:38.940
So whatever we have implemented 'til Ingress Basic,

02:38.940 --> 02:40.830
the same thing I have copied here.

02:40.830 --> 02:42.360
We still didn't implement

02:42.360 --> 02:44.970
any of the path based routing here.

02:44.970 --> 02:48.990
So let's go ahead and then implement the path based routing.

02:48.990 --> 02:52.050
So our path based routing is we have two more paths now.

02:52.050 --> 02:54.480
So let's go ahead and then implement.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.880
So this path, I'll copy-paste,

02:56.880 --> 03:00.150
and then go to the Home, and then path, right?

03:00.150 --> 03:01.440
And one more also I have,

03:01.440 --> 03:03.570
which is nothing but one more, right?

03:03.570 --> 03:04.870
So I will say

03:07.006 --> 03:10.290
app1/*, right? Is the path.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.550
If it comes here,

03:11.550 --> 03:14.160
then it need to go to app1 NodePort service.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.830
So I'll go to 05, nginx-nodeport-service,

03:16.830 --> 03:18.630
and then I'll find this information, right?

03:18.630 --> 03:21.540
app1-nginx-nodeport-service.

03:21.540 --> 03:24.540
And I'll come and then update it.

03:24.540 --> 03:27.510
And what is the port we are supposed to use?

03:27.510 --> 03:31.170
The port, it is going to be port 80, right?

03:31.170 --> 03:32.823
So this is the one.

03:32.823 --> 03:37.740
Now, I have something called app2/*, right?

03:37.740 --> 03:39.930
So now for app2/*,

03:39.930 --> 03:43.470
we should have our app2 NodePort service, right?

03:43.470 --> 03:46.410
So which is nothing but this one.

03:46.410 --> 03:48.480
So let me copy this,

03:48.480 --> 03:51.150
come back, and then update it.

03:51.150 --> 03:54.570
And the port is going to be 80.

03:54.570 --> 03:56.940
And finally, anything after app1 and app2,

03:56.940 --> 03:58.800
anything other than app1 and app2,

03:58.800 --> 04:00.390
if it comes with /*,

04:00.390 --> 04:05.390
go to my usermgmt-restapp-nodeport-service with 8095.

04:05.580 --> 04:07.680
So now one thing important here is,

04:07.680 --> 04:10.170
an important note is...

04:10.170 --> 04:13.241
Okay, important note which we need to know is

04:13.241 --> 04:17.970
always, right, /* should be at the end.

04:20.008 --> 04:23.502
So the pods will be validated like this, okay?

04:23.502 --> 04:26.160
So first, if it is /app1, it will find it and then do it.

04:26.160 --> 04:29.400
If this /*, if you put it at the starting...

04:29.400 --> 04:31.110
So the order is very important.

04:31.110 --> 04:32.700
If you put /* at the starting,

04:32.700 --> 04:34.170
even if you send app1, app2,

04:34.170 --> 04:35.547
he will send the,

04:35.547 --> 04:36.930
the application load balancer

04:36.930 --> 04:40.500
will send it to usermgmt-restapp-nodeport-service only.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.470
So always, in this context path-related stuff,

04:43.470 --> 04:47.070
always we need to put /* as our last path

04:47.070 --> 04:50.100
for our entire manifest, okay?

04:50.100 --> 04:52.080
So like that, we need to implement.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.330
So now here is one more problem we have,

04:54.330 --> 04:56.820
so which I also mentioned in the step here,

04:56.820 --> 04:59.250
which is update health check path annotation

04:59.250 --> 05:02.130
in your usermgmt-restapp-nodeport-service, okay?

05:02.130 --> 05:04.650
So now if I deploy this, what happens?

05:04.650 --> 05:08.430
Okay, what happens is, for all my three applications,

05:08.430 --> 05:12.600
ideally, if I really didn't define these things here, okay,

05:12.600 --> 05:14.460
if I didn't define these things here,

05:14.460 --> 05:16.800
annotation and then health check part there,

05:16.800 --> 05:18.210
for all the applications,

05:18.210 --> 05:21.270
it is going to give user management health status,

05:21.270 --> 05:22.800
and then it is going to throw an error

05:22.800 --> 05:23.950
for app1 and then app2.

05:25.170 --> 05:27.870
Due to avoid such type of situations,

05:27.870 --> 05:31.950
like whatever is applicable at the NodePort service level,

05:31.950 --> 05:34.260
we need to move them to the NodePort service level.

05:34.260 --> 05:35.820
What all are generic,

05:35.820 --> 05:38.280
then you can have them in the ingress template.

05:38.280 --> 05:40.230
So again, I'm going to repeat this:

05:40.230 --> 05:43.140
What all are generic for all the applications

05:43.140 --> 05:46.980
which you are having load balancing as part of ingress,

05:46.980 --> 05:50.640
so generic, you can have it in this ingress template.

05:50.640 --> 05:53.430
And whatever you feel like these are specific

05:53.430 --> 05:56.100
to those respective application,

05:56.100 --> 05:58.320
move them under that application.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.570
For me, these things are generic.

06:00.570 --> 06:01.830
I really don't want to change...

06:01.830 --> 06:04.740
Every application have these settings, as usual.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.210
And for NodePort service,

06:06.210 --> 06:08.130
I want to move this from here,

06:08.130 --> 06:11.820
and then move under my user management NodePort service

06:11.820 --> 06:12.780
example here, okay?

06:12.780 --> 06:14.340
I already put it here,

06:14.340 --> 06:16.560
but if you want it, you can move there.

06:16.560 --> 06:17.970
So you need to add annotations,

06:17.970 --> 06:19.530
and then move that from here.

06:19.530 --> 06:22.650
So which means I need to just comment this here,

06:22.650 --> 06:24.840
so that I really don't (speaks faintly).

06:24.840 --> 06:27.360
So these are the changes we are supposed to do

06:27.360 --> 06:29.760
as part of context path based routing.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.650
So one is add the pods.

06:31.650 --> 06:34.560
And then move /* at the end.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.960
And then ensure that your health check path

06:36.960 --> 06:41.193
is moved to a respective NodePort service,

06:42.143 --> 06:43.530
where it should be configured.

06:43.530 --> 06:44.363
That's all.

06:44.363 --> 06:45.870
And in these things also,

06:45.870 --> 06:47.850
you have configured your health checkers,

06:47.850 --> 06:49.290
app1 in the start HTML.

06:49.290 --> 06:51.360
and then app2 in the start HTML.

06:51.360 --> 06:52.950
So in our next lecture,

06:52.950 --> 06:56.940
we'll focus on implementing them and then testing them.

06:56.940 --> 06:58.680
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.393
Until then, bye bye. Thank you.
