00:00.150 --> 00:00.983
-: Welcome back.

00:00.983 --> 00:01.816
In this lecture,

00:01.816 --> 00:03.810
we are going to register a domain in

00:03.810 --> 00:04.980
Route 53.

00:04.980 --> 00:08.610
So we are going to buy the domain cube on cloud.com.

00:08.610 --> 00:11.730
So let's go to AWS management console,

00:11.730 --> 00:14.823
and on the console home search for Route 53.

00:17.700 --> 00:20.370
And in route 53, we'll go further

00:20.370 --> 00:22.560
register domains.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.780
And then we are going to register a domain.

00:24.780 --> 00:28.330
And the domain name is going to be cube on

00:29.280 --> 00:30.217
cloud.com.

00:31.298 --> 00:33.810
Okay, so it took something else here.

00:33.810 --> 00:35.220
Remove R here.

00:35.220 --> 00:36.603
Yeah, check it, okay.

00:38.850 --> 00:39.900
And we got it

00:39.900 --> 00:42.090
cube on cloud.com.

00:42.090 --> 00:43.380
So everything looks good.

00:43.380 --> 00:46.710
K-u-b on cloud.com right?

00:46.710 --> 00:47.950
So add to cart

00:49.230 --> 00:51.270
and go down.

00:51.270 --> 00:53.200
And if you see here, you can click on

00:54.270 --> 00:55.140
continue.

00:55.140 --> 00:57.000
And these are the personal information;

00:57.000 --> 00:58.290
we can leave it,

00:58.290 --> 01:00.840
and you can see privacy protection enabled

01:00.840 --> 01:02.910
pharma domain enabled.

01:02.910 --> 01:05.010
And then I'll click on continue.

01:05.010 --> 01:06.480
And if I go here,

01:06.480 --> 01:09.330
do you want to automatically renew your domain?

01:09.330 --> 01:10.920
Yes, I want to renew it.

01:10.920 --> 01:14.790
And terms and conditions, I'm going to accept it

01:14.790 --> 01:17.520
and then click on complete the

01:17.520 --> 01:18.390
order.

01:18.390 --> 01:21.060
So our order got submitted successfully.

01:21.060 --> 01:24.000
It might take close to three days to complete it usually,

01:24.000 --> 01:25.890
but once we verify our payment,

01:25.890 --> 01:27.540
usually it might be faster

01:27.540 --> 01:29.010
in a day or even

01:29.010 --> 01:30.720
lesser than that.

01:30.720 --> 01:31.950
So we'll go to

01:31.950 --> 01:33.180
domains,

01:33.180 --> 01:35.310
And my other domain is in action

01:35.310 --> 01:36.780
required for verified payment.

01:36.780 --> 01:37.613
I will leave it

01:37.613 --> 01:40.290
once this also comes into that same status.

01:40.290 --> 01:41.123
We will

01:41.123 --> 01:42.390
verify for this one.

01:42.390 --> 01:43.920
Okay, cube on cloud dot.

01:43.920 --> 01:46.240
So I got the action required for Q1

01:47.130 --> 01:47.963
cloud.

01:47.963 --> 01:49.200
So I'll go there

01:49.200 --> 01:50.160
at the end

01:50.160 --> 01:52.620
and then I'll do the

01:52.620 --> 01:54.660
verify payment for the latest one.

01:54.660 --> 01:56.226
Okay, 2199,

01:56.226 --> 01:57.059
I'll go there.

02:00.060 --> 02:02.010
So one I accidentally sent it,

02:02.010 --> 02:03.510
so I really don't want to pay

02:03.510 --> 02:04.920
for the other one.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.210
So,

02:06.210 --> 02:11.210
now if you see 4 8 3 3 0 2 6 0 1 and then 2877.

02:11.580 --> 02:13.710
So 2877 is the latest.

02:13.710 --> 02:16.200
I'm going to say verify and then

02:16.200 --> 02:17.880
pay, right?

02:17.880 --> 02:20.163
So I'm going to pay now.

02:24.480 --> 02:27.090
So let's wait for the payment to

02:27.090 --> 02:27.923
happen.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.120
Okay, I provided the OTP

02:33.120 --> 02:35.160
and this should be done now.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.620
So we have completed the payments

02:37.620 --> 02:42.240
if we go for bills, orders and then invoices.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.560
So one should be like that only

02:43.560 --> 02:45.300
and then one should be already

02:45.300 --> 02:46.380
paid, okay.

02:46.380 --> 02:48.240
So let's wait for some time,

02:48.240 --> 02:52.320
or go to registered domains here and then pending requests.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.000
Okay, so it'll take an hour

02:54.000 --> 02:55.590
to update the status.

02:55.590 --> 02:58.140
So let's wait for an hour to see what happens.

02:58.140 --> 03:01.020
So once we create, once we have completed the verify

03:01.020 --> 03:03.810
and pay, so we can see that for Cube on Cloud,

03:03.810 --> 03:05.910
we can see domain illustration is in

03:05.910 --> 03:06.900
progress.

03:06.900 --> 03:09.540
So let's wait for everything to be completed

03:09.540 --> 03:10.373
now.

03:10.373 --> 03:13.560
So within an hour I have seen that my request has been moved

03:13.560 --> 03:14.393
from

03:14.393 --> 03:15.480
pending request to

03:15.480 --> 03:16.860
register domains.

03:16.860 --> 03:19.290
So hardly within less than two hours

03:19.290 --> 03:20.940
entire process will be

03:20.940 --> 03:22.590
completed for us further

03:22.590 --> 03:23.970
register a domain

03:23.970 --> 03:25.500
and only one thing is

03:25.500 --> 03:27.150
we need to verify our payment

03:27.150 --> 03:27.983
thoroughly.

03:27.983 --> 03:28.890
That's about it.

03:28.890 --> 03:31.800
So now I have the Cube on Cloud dot domain available

03:31.800 --> 03:32.633
for me,

03:32.633 --> 03:34.140
cube on cloud.com,

03:34.140 --> 03:37.050
And then it's a restrain is verified

03:37.050 --> 03:39.120
and we can see all the details about it.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.860
If you want to extend this domain

03:40.860 --> 03:42.750
for another nine to 10 years, if you want

03:42.750 --> 03:44.550
you can do that now.

03:44.550 --> 03:48.000
Okay. And auto renew is anyway enabled

03:48.000 --> 03:51.900
so every year it'll automatically get auto renewed.

03:51.900 --> 03:54.120
So now one important thing here is if you click

03:54.120 --> 03:57.030
on managed DNS, it'll take us to the hosted zone.

03:57.030 --> 03:58.560
So the

03:58.560 --> 03:59.640
public hosted zone

03:59.640 --> 04:02.040
for cube on cloud.com is already

04:02.040 --> 04:03.900
by default created. Okay.

04:03.900 --> 04:06.700
So now here we will be able to DNS register our

04:07.829 --> 04:08.662
domains.

04:08.662 --> 04:10.890
Okay, so whatever the sub domains we want to

04:10.890 --> 04:13.440
register are whatever the main domains we want to register

04:13.440 --> 04:14.910
we can create a

04:14.910 --> 04:15.840
record set here,

04:15.840 --> 04:17.780
and then say that users dot cube

04:17.780 --> 04:19.680
on cloud.com and then

04:19.680 --> 04:21.870
provide the IP address

04:21.870 --> 04:24.210
or the ALB DNS name,

04:24.210 --> 04:25.170
E L B D N S name

04:25.170 --> 04:28.020
all these things here to DNS register it.

04:28.020 --> 04:30.467
Okay, so this is about

04:30.467 --> 04:31.920
the resisted domain section

04:31.920 --> 04:33.480
which is nothing but our step two

04:33.480 --> 04:35.580
resist a domain in Route 53.

04:35.580 --> 04:37.050
In our next lecture, we'll focus

04:37.050 --> 04:38.820
on creating a SSL certificate

04:38.820 --> 04:40.650
in certificate manager.

04:40.650 --> 04:42.210
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

04:42.210 --> 04:43.260
Until then, bye bye.

04:43.260 --> 04:44.093
Thank you.
