00:00.000 --> 00:00.833
-: Welcome back.

00:00.833 --> 00:01.666
So let's go ahead,

00:01.666 --> 00:04.230
and then deploy all the manifests, and then test it.

00:04.230 --> 00:07.411
As of now, if we access the ssldemo, right?

00:07.411 --> 00:12.411
http:// and then, ssldemo.kubeoncloud.com.

00:13.560 --> 00:18.560
And if I say, /app1/index.html,

00:20.340 --> 00:24.720
it's a, let me take this as HTTP URL, and then test it.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.220
Okay? So let me close it,

00:26.220 --> 00:29.730
and take the new private window, right?

00:29.730 --> 00:34.080
And I'm going to access HTTP, and then test it.

00:34.080 --> 00:37.020
So once we implement again, we can test this one, right?

00:37.020 --> 00:40.410
So, and then, it surfs the not secure page

00:40.410 --> 00:43.110
which is nothing but whatever we have provided, HTTP,

00:43.110 --> 00:45.510
it provided the HTTP URL only.

00:45.510 --> 00:47.130
And once we implement this change,

00:47.130 --> 00:48.930
even though if we provide HTTP,

00:48.930 --> 00:50.880
it is going to redirect to HTTPs.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.470
So let me close this,

00:52.470 --> 00:57.470
and go back to our browser, and then implement this.

00:57.810 --> 01:00.720
Okay? So let's go back to terminal,

01:00.720 --> 01:05.010
and then go to 08-ELB application Load Balancer.

01:05.010 --> 01:07.930
And inside that, we are going to go to 0805

01:08.779 --> 01:12.240
which is ALB Ingress SSL redirect, okay?

01:12.240 --> 01:15.510
And kubectl apply -f kube-manifest. Okay?

01:15.510 --> 01:18.090
So what happens here is already other things are created,

01:18.090 --> 01:19.770
Pod, Deployment, all those things.

01:19.770 --> 01:21.060
So those will not be,

01:21.060 --> 01:22.860
those will be in unchanged state.

01:22.860 --> 01:26.280
Only the Ingress usermgmt-restapp-service will be configured

01:26.280 --> 01:30.090
with whatever the additional changes we have applied here.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.650
Okay? So the additional two changes

01:31.650 --> 01:33.660
which is SSL redirect setting,

01:33.660 --> 01:36.630
and then SSL redirect path, right?

01:36.630 --> 01:41.630
So now, let's go to our EC2 Management Console,

01:42.150 --> 01:46.890
and refresh our Load Balancer, right?

01:46.890 --> 01:51.030
And let's go ahead, and then edit the HTTP 80 rule.

01:51.030 --> 01:53.040
Earlier, you have seen all other rules.

01:53.040 --> 01:56.160
So now, you see automatically this has been changed.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.090
So earlier you have seen app1, app2,

01:58.090 --> 02:00.270
and then, /* for user management.

02:00.270 --> 02:02.730
But now, the rule has been changed stating

02:02.730 --> 02:04.680
that path: /*

02:04.680 --> 02:09.120
then go https host:443/ again, /path

02:09.120 --> 02:14.120
and then ? and then query, and then status code is HTTP_301.

02:14.220 --> 02:17.430
So this change, whatever we applied, it took place, okay?

02:17.430 --> 02:21.000
So now, we are going to say, file, new private window,

02:21.000 --> 02:22.620
and then I'm going to say,

02:22.620 --> 02:27.620
http//ssldemokubeoncloud.com, right?

02:29.289 --> 02:34.289
And so, I'm going to say app1/index.html.

02:34.620 --> 02:37.230
So it should redirect to HTTPs.

02:37.230 --> 02:38.550
You can see that, right?

02:38.550 --> 02:41.370
So, now, I can close this again,

02:41.370 --> 02:44.400
and then, I can open a new private window,

02:44.400 --> 02:45.233
and I can say,

02:45.233 --> 02:50.180
http://ssldemo.kubeoncloud.com /usermgmt/health-status.

02:56.640 --> 02:59.670
Okay? So now, if I click on Enter,

02:59.670 --> 03:02.880
it should redirect to HTTPs, right?

03:02.880 --> 03:06.510
It redirected. You can see the secure symbol here, right?

03:06.510 --> 03:09.300
So you can even see the certificate here. Okay?

03:09.300 --> 03:10.230
So that's about it.

03:10.230 --> 03:11.850
So whatever we implemented,

03:11.850 --> 03:14.850
it has been taken place, and then working as expected.

03:14.850 --> 03:17.340
Okay? So let me close this browser,

03:17.340 --> 03:19.650
and then come back to our steps,

03:19.650 --> 03:23.070
and we have implemented, and then tested everything.

03:23.070 --> 03:27.240
So the next thing is if you want to, means like, this one,

03:27.240 --> 03:28.410
this step, you can remove.

03:28.410 --> 03:31.260
So I added unnecessarily. Okay?

03:31.260 --> 03:32.550
So I'll remove it. Okay?

03:32.550 --> 03:34.440
So now, you have accessed the application,

03:34.440 --> 03:35.400
and then tested it,

03:35.400 --> 03:38.160
and then now, finally, you can clean it up. Okay?

03:38.160 --> 03:41.934
So now, you can clean it up whatever we have implemented.

03:41.934 --> 03:45.363
Okay? And then kube-manifest. Okay?

03:51.720 --> 03:54.240
So I have completed the cleaning of the manifest.

03:54.240 --> 03:55.890
So if you go here, and then refresh,

03:55.890 --> 03:57.300
no load balancer is available.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.740
One thing, we need to do is we need

03:58.740 --> 04:03.120
to manually remove our ssldemokubeoncloud record set. Okay?

04:03.120 --> 04:04.500
So this also charges money.

04:04.500 --> 04:07.200
So ideally, if it is minor cents only

04:07.200 --> 04:09.080
but why we need to have it here. Okay?

04:09.080 --> 04:12.210
So our demo related to SSL is completed.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.460
I will delete this. Okay?

04:14.460 --> 04:15.720
So this is gone.

04:15.720 --> 04:18.420
The next thing here is, cleanup is done.

04:18.420 --> 04:19.560
One important thing you need

04:19.560 --> 04:21.630
to know about Annotation References,

04:21.630 --> 04:24.300
about the location where this Annotation can be put.

04:24.300 --> 04:25.590
Okay? So this is additional tip.

04:25.590 --> 04:28.680
So, we'll open this in a browser, right?

04:28.680 --> 04:31.050
And if you see this Annotation table, right?

04:31.050 --> 04:33.810
So this Annotation can be created only

04:33.810 --> 04:35.370
in the ingress manifest,

04:35.370 --> 04:37.740
means like this Annotation, you need to only update

04:37.740 --> 04:39.420
in ingress manifest.

04:39.420 --> 04:42.510
You can see other Annotations, they can be provided both

04:42.510 --> 04:46.320
in ingress, service, either ingress or either in service.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.153
Service, in the sense,

04:47.153 --> 04:49.980
whatever the node port service we are creating there,

04:49.980 --> 04:50.970
you can add it.

04:50.970 --> 04:55.970
So the best example for it is our health check URL, right?

04:56.610 --> 05:00.000
So ALB Ingress Health Check path, right?

05:00.000 --> 05:03.090
So this will be provided, means like it can be used

05:03.090 --> 05:07.320
either in ingress manifest or, in the service manifest

05:07.320 --> 05:09.330
which is nothing but our node port service.

05:09.330 --> 05:11.010
So like that, the location

05:11.010 --> 05:13.380
of Annotations will be provided here

05:13.380 --> 05:14.940
where you need to add it accordingly.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.460
We need to be careful about where we are adding.

05:17.460 --> 05:20.100
So if you have a service level scope for that then,

05:20.100 --> 05:21.870
and then, if you need it in service level

05:21.870 --> 05:23.250
for specific applications.

05:23.250 --> 05:24.600
You have 10 applications,

05:24.600 --> 05:27.540
and then you want the asked session cookie to be only

05:27.540 --> 05:29.070
from one specific application.

05:29.070 --> 05:32.970
So you can apply that only in that respective service level.

05:32.970 --> 05:35.700
So like that, the greatest advantage also we have

05:35.700 --> 05:37.740
with these Annotations related

05:37.740 --> 05:40.920
to Application Load Balancer in our ingress manifest.

05:40.920 --> 05:45.920
Okay? So this completes our SSL redirect section,

05:46.710 --> 05:48.960
and in our next lecture, we are going to work

05:48.960 --> 05:51.780
on ALB Ingress External DNS, okay?

05:51.780 --> 05:54.240
So, so far, you went to route 53,

05:54.240 --> 05:57.120
and then, adding the things manually here, right?

05:57.120 --> 06:01.080
So, but once we implement the External DNS concepts,

06:01.080 --> 06:03.540
so once you deploy all the manifests,

06:03.540 --> 06:05.970
then automatically, your Route 53 records

06:05.970 --> 06:08.820
that also get created automatically.

06:08.820 --> 06:13.140
So in our next section, we are going to deal with that.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.210
So, I'll see you in the next lecture.

06:15.210 --> 06:16.680
Until then, bye bye.

06:16.680 --> 06:17.513
Thank you.
