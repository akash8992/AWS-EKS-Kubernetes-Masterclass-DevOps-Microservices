WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.833
-: Welcome back.

00:00.833 --> 00:03.240
So we are in our GitHub repo.

00:03.240 --> 00:07.290
So let's get into our EKS storage with RDS database section

00:07.290 --> 00:08.730
which is zero six section.

00:08.730 --> 00:11.538
Okay? So the step one introduction just now

00:11.538 --> 00:13.410
we have completed, which is nothing

00:13.410 --> 00:15.480
but what are the problems with myas skill port

00:15.480 --> 00:17.040
and then EBS CSA

00:17.040 --> 00:20.676
and how are we going to solve them with AWS RDS database?

00:20.676 --> 00:23.670
So now we need to review the VPC

00:23.670 --> 00:26.525
which is created as part of our EKS cluster.

00:26.525 --> 00:28.230
The reason for that is

00:28.230 --> 00:31.525
because inside that VPC in the private subject

00:31.525 --> 00:36.525
we are going to create our respected RDS database.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.811
Okay? So let's go to EC two

00:38.811 --> 00:43.811
and let's go here and from go to VPC.

00:51.390 --> 00:53.880
And if you see we have two VPCs available

00:53.880 --> 00:56.250
one should be default and then one created

00:56.250 --> 01:00.750
as part of our EKS CTL EKS demo one VPC.

01:00.750 --> 01:02.430
So now as part of this VPC

01:02.430 --> 01:05.853
it might have already created the subnets, right?

01:05.853 --> 01:10.080
So if you see here, so these are the subnets it has created.

01:10.080 --> 01:12.990
Okay? So it has created the two private subnets in one is

01:12.990 --> 01:16.940
in US east one year and then one is in US East one B.

01:16.940 --> 01:19.710
So we are going to create the RDS database

01:19.710 --> 01:21.510
in these private subnets.

01:21.510 --> 01:25.204
Okay, So let's go ahead and then create them now.

01:25.204 --> 01:30.000
So where is this?

01:30.000 --> 01:32.820
Yeah, so we have reviewed and then understood that

01:32.820 --> 01:36.864
as part of this cluster it created four subnets two private

01:36.864 --> 01:38.220
and then two public.

01:38.220 --> 01:40.320
And our cluster notes means like our easy to

01:40.320 --> 01:43.080
worker notes are currently running in public subnets

01:43.080 --> 01:46.551
and the RDS database we are creating in the private subnet.

01:46.551 --> 01:49.411
So let's create a DB security group

01:49.411 --> 01:51.690
for us as a prerequisite one

01:51.690 --> 01:55.120
which we'll leverage when creating the security group.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.370
So let me go to EC two here

01:59.987 --> 02:03.320
and I will go to security groups, right?

02:04.909 --> 02:06.522
And I'll create a security group.

02:06.522 --> 02:09.000
And the name of the security group is this.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.680
And I can also copy this and I'll paste it.

02:13.680 --> 02:17.208
Allow access for RDS database on port 3 3 0 6

02:17.208 --> 02:22.080
and the VPCs EKS CTL EKS demo one cluster VPC.

02:22.080 --> 02:25.530
Okay? And I'm going to add the inbound rule saying

02:25.530 --> 02:27.030
that myas skill, right?

02:27.030 --> 02:30.480
So I'm going to allow access for myas skill 3 3 0 6

02:30.480 --> 02:33.330
from anywhere even as it is in private subnet.

02:33.330 --> 02:35.460
Ideally we really don't need to worry.

02:35.460 --> 02:39.420
So even if you say access from anywhere, okay

02:39.420 --> 02:44.420
so I'll create the security group and this is completed.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.368
So the next step is to prerequisite two

02:47.368 --> 02:51.266
create a DB subnet group in RDS, right?

02:51.266 --> 02:55.440
So let's go to RDS service, so search

02:55.440 --> 03:00.440
for RDS here and select the RDS national database Service.

03:05.670 --> 03:07.680
And once it is open

03:07.680 --> 03:11.130
so we are going to create a DB subnet group

03:11.130 --> 03:14.643
okay with us east one year and then one B.

03:17.010 --> 03:18.960
So we'll go here and then you can see

03:18.960 --> 03:22.020
in the left navigation, you can see the subnet groups here.

03:22.020 --> 03:25.830
So I'm going to create a subnet group like this

03:25.830 --> 03:30.660
and we'll also have description, EKS, RDS db subnet group

03:30.660 --> 03:31.870
choose vpc.

03:31.870 --> 03:34.590
VPC is our eks, ctl EKS demo one.

03:34.590 --> 03:37.920
And availability zones we are going to use one year

03:37.920 --> 03:41.550
and then one B so that whatever the audio's database it

03:41.550 --> 03:45.287
gets created can be available in those locations and

03:45.287 --> 03:46.770
in one year.

03:46.770 --> 03:50.370
And then one B, what are our private things, right?

03:50.370 --> 03:52.620
Private subnets we need to select now.

03:52.620 --> 03:57.453
So let's go to VPC and identify which are our private subnet

04:02.340 --> 04:03.173
things, okay?

04:03.173 --> 04:06.240
So we have four here.

04:06.240 --> 04:11.240
Let's go here and go to subnets and prove subnet this one.

04:15.390 --> 04:17.733
So it is 64 dot 0 slash 19.

04:19.193 --> 04:20.443
So that is one.

04:22.314 --> 04:25.065
So I'll select a 64 dot 0.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.898
Okay? So that is one.

04:26.898 --> 04:31.898
And in one B it is going to be 96 dot 0 slash 19.

04:34.210 --> 04:37.530
Okay? So I'm going to select 96, okay?

04:37.530 --> 04:41.400
So 64 and 96 are private subnets here.

04:41.400 --> 04:45.120
So in our DB subnet group we created that and then

04:45.120 --> 04:47.103
we are going to create it.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.110
Okay? So now our DB subnet group got created.

04:52.110 --> 04:55.533
So we are going to create the RDS database.

04:55.533 --> 05:00.533
Okay? So let's go back here and then go to databases

05:01.350 --> 05:04.443
and create a database, right?

05:05.400 --> 05:08.370
And we are going to create a standard create.

05:08.370 --> 05:11.430
So that's what we have selected here.

05:11.430 --> 05:13.750
And the engine is going to be myas skill

05:15.840 --> 05:17.940
And it is going to be a

05:17.940 --> 05:20.970
myas skill communication and the version

05:20.970 --> 05:24.510
whatever it is populated automatically I'm using it, okay?

05:24.510 --> 05:26.130
So we really don't need to worry

05:26.130 --> 05:28.380
about what version it populates here.

05:28.380 --> 05:30.180
Even in future when you see it

05:30.180 --> 05:33.270
it might be 5 7, 2, 2 or five eight.

05:33.270 --> 05:35.640
Our application is going to work everywhere.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.280
Okay? So now the next thing is we are going to

05:38.280 --> 05:39.750
select free tier.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.490
Okay? So if you use production

05:41.490 --> 05:42.810
you'll have the high availability

05:42.810 --> 05:45.120
and fast consistent performance.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.550
And if it is free tier, you are going to use a single

05:47.550 --> 05:50.610
nor far our RDS database testing.

05:50.610 --> 05:52.950
So we are going to use free tier for now

05:52.950 --> 05:56.190
and the DB instance identifier, okay

05:56.190 --> 05:59.550
so we are going to say user MGMT db.

05:59.550 --> 06:01.980
So that is what we are going to use the name.

06:01.980 --> 06:04.620
So this name, whatever you want, you can put it.

06:04.620 --> 06:09.620
So, and the master username we are going to use is DB admin.

06:10.590 --> 06:13.094
Okay? So now the DB admin will be my master

06:13.094 --> 06:15.090
username to connect to it.

06:15.090 --> 06:17.619
So we also need to update our user management

06:17.619 --> 06:20.790
deployment manifest there.

06:20.790 --> 06:22.440
We'll do it in our next steps.

06:22.440 --> 06:23.400
Earlier we have given

06:23.400 --> 06:25.000
whenever we have a myas skill pod running

06:25.000 --> 06:29.400
inside EKS cluster, we have user there, root user there.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.271
So now we need to update that root user to

06:31.271 --> 06:35.904
DB admin and password, we are going to use that same one

06:35.904 --> 06:40.380
which is nothing, but we are going to use DB password one.

06:40.380 --> 06:43.830
One, Okay, so what is this?

06:43.830 --> 06:44.913
Why it is showing?

06:46.800 --> 06:49.830
So my safari browser auto generated something here

06:49.830 --> 06:51.030
I'm not going to use that.

06:51.030 --> 06:55.350
I'll say don't use and I will use DB password one, one.

06:55.350 --> 06:57.600
So whatever we have generated

06:57.600 --> 06:59.149
as a Kubernetes secret, right?

06:59.149 --> 07:02.010
So the same thing I'm going to use.

07:02.010 --> 07:06.183
So DB password one, one.

07:10.050 --> 07:12.120
Good. So now instance size

07:12.120 --> 07:15.390
I'm going to leave it as T two micro one, CPU one GB.

07:15.390 --> 07:17.220
That should be fine for us.

07:17.220 --> 07:18.554
And the general purpose storage.

07:18.554 --> 07:20.820
And then all these things, 20 GB.

07:20.820 --> 07:23.850
I'm going to leave these things as is here

07:23.850 --> 07:26.940
and we are going to say availability and durability

07:26.940 --> 07:29.940
we are going to leave it as is here, okay?

07:29.940 --> 07:31.290
So if you want the once

07:31.290 --> 07:33.960
if we would've selected the production here

07:33.960 --> 07:36.990
then obviously would've got the automatic

07:36.990 --> 07:38.858
this option would have been enabled here.

07:38.858 --> 07:41.186
And then multi asay deployment we have done.

07:41.186 --> 07:43.730
But this is for our testing purpose.

07:43.730 --> 07:46.170
We really don't need to worry about these things.

07:46.170 --> 07:51.170
Okay, so now what in vpc we are going to say eks, CT L vpc

07:51.240 --> 07:52.637
which we want to create this.

07:52.637 --> 07:56.580
And inside that vpc, this is the DB subnet group.

07:56.580 --> 07:59.064
We have selected eks, RDS DB subnet group

07:59.064 --> 08:01.980
and we are creating in the private subnet

08:01.980 --> 08:03.240
we really don't need to worry

08:03.240 --> 08:06.570
about publicly accessible default is no

08:06.570 --> 08:11.570
and choose an existing security group as a prerequisite one.

08:12.420 --> 08:13.320
We have created

08:13.320 --> 08:16.890
that VPC security group means like DB security group.

08:16.890 --> 08:18.750
So let's go ahead and then select that.

08:18.750 --> 08:20.130
So which is nothing but E eks

08:20.130 --> 08:25.130
RDS db sg, okay, so what happened?

08:28.920 --> 08:29.970
Remove the default one.

08:29.970 --> 08:32.610
We only need eks RDS DB sg.

08:32.610 --> 08:33.960
So that is selected here.

08:33.960 --> 08:37.650
And then default one, we have remote and availability zone.

08:37.650 --> 08:41.010
I wanted to be created in US east one year

08:41.010 --> 08:45.300
and database port, I'm going to use 33 0 6, okay?

08:45.300 --> 08:47.340
So I'm going to use the password authentication

08:47.340 --> 08:49.260
which is nothing but DV password 11

08:49.260 --> 08:50.880
whatever we have created.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.870
Okay? So these are additional database options

08:53.870 --> 08:57.120
if you want to use, so initial database

08:57.120 --> 08:58.350
whatever you want to create.

08:58.350 --> 09:01.315
So I can directly say user MGMT to DB schema

09:01.315 --> 09:05.610
IT need to get created here and all these things.

09:05.610 --> 09:07.560
So let's go here.

09:07.560 --> 09:11.080
And I really didn't worry much about other stuff here, but

09:12.480 --> 09:17.050
if you want the initial database, you can say user MGMT db.

09:18.570 --> 09:22.650
So this schema is required for us to automatically

09:22.650 --> 09:26.130
create this schema will help us to connect to this.

09:26.130 --> 09:29.100
It means like whenever our user management

09:29.100 --> 09:31.170
application spring boot application starts

09:31.170 --> 09:34.183
it expects this database schema available for us.

09:34.183 --> 09:38.820
Okay? So user MGMT db, you can directly give it here

09:38.820 --> 09:43.820
if you want to, or you can leave it as is and then move on.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.040
And then I have created one more step for us.

09:47.040 --> 09:48.630
So that is an interesting step.

09:48.630 --> 09:52.048
Okay? So the reason I created that way is

09:52.048 --> 09:56.520
from our Kubernetes cube ct, I should be able to connect

09:56.520 --> 09:59.670
to the RDS database and then run the commands

09:59.670 --> 10:02.070
for myas skill because it is in private subnet

10:02.070 --> 10:05.160
you cannot connect via internet or from your desktop, right?

10:05.160 --> 10:08.430
But from our Kubernetes cluster, using Cube ctl

10:08.430 --> 10:10.380
you'll be able to connect.

10:10.380 --> 10:13.350
So to ex to use this step and then create the

10:13.350 --> 10:15.572
user M GMT schema from here

10:15.572 --> 10:19.620
ideally not using this configuration option to

10:19.620 --> 10:23.372
create a initial database name, so just for our learning.

10:23.372 --> 10:26.089
And then in future, if you have any issues to connect

10:26.089 --> 10:28.106
to the database, RDS database

10:28.106 --> 10:30.660
then you need to know the way, how you need to

10:30.660 --> 10:33.810
connect it when it is in the private subnet, right?

10:33.810 --> 10:36.090
So for that purpose, I am not initializing

10:36.090 --> 10:39.150
or not creating a initial database user mgmt

10:39.150 --> 10:43.560
which is required by our user management microservice.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.781
So we will leave it empty and then we'll create

10:46.781 --> 10:49.110
at this respective to step four so far.

10:49.110 --> 10:52.682
Now we'll move on and then create the database, right?

10:52.682 --> 10:57.682
So now if you want this password to be saved here

10:57.690 --> 10:58.523
in my, this one, not now.

10:58.523 --> 11:00.600
Okay? So I really don't care.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.240
So it'll take close to 10 minutes

11:03.240 --> 11:05.520
or something to create this database.

11:05.520 --> 11:08.010
So I will pause the video

11:08.010 --> 11:11.250
and then our database is available now.

11:11.250 --> 11:14.350
So if you click on this user MGMT db

11:15.210 --> 11:17.040
so you'll find the endpoint here.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.920
So this is the endpoint we are going to configure

11:19.920 --> 11:24.920
in our external name service so that our workloads running

11:25.110 --> 11:27.810
on Kubernetes cluster will be able to connect

11:27.810 --> 11:30.420
to this RDS database.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.370
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

11:32.370 --> 11:33.497
Until then, bye bye.

11:33.497 --> 11:34.330
Thank you.
