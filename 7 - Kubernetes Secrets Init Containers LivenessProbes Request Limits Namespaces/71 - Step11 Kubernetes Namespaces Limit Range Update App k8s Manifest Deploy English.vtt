00:00.120 --> 00:00.953
-: Welcome back.

00:00.953 --> 00:02.610
So in this lecture we are going to create

00:02.610 --> 00:04.680
the Kubernetes objects and then test it.

00:04.680 --> 00:07.980
And then also, go ahead and then clean up the stuff.

00:07.980 --> 00:11.520
So as usual, now we are going to create the stuff, okay.

00:11.520 --> 00:14.910
So in 0502 you can see you have the 'Cube manifest' folder.

00:14.910 --> 00:16.980
And then inside that you have all the files

00:16.980 --> 00:19.842
with 00 namespace, 'Limit range' added now, okay.

00:19.842 --> 00:20.675
(mouse clicks)

00:20.675 --> 00:23.043
So let's come back and be in 0502.

00:24.390 --> 00:26.250
050502.

00:26.250 --> 00:27.669
And I will say

00:27.669 --> 00:29.718
(typing)

00:29.718 --> 00:33.360
'Q-CTL', 'Apply Hyphen F' 'Q manifest', Okay.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.740
So now you really don't need to

00:34.740 --> 00:37.500
view 'Hyphen N', 'DEV-3' of something.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.480
Why? Because 'Hyphen N', 'DEV-3' is not needed

00:39.480 --> 00:43.350
because we have coded our namespace information

00:43.350 --> 00:44.940
in all the templates.

00:44.940 --> 00:47.097
Okay, so I'll say 'Apply'.

00:48.390 --> 00:50.220
So it should create the namespace

00:50.220 --> 00:52.680
and then it should create the limit range and then it

00:52.680 --> 00:55.590
it created the 'Storage class', 'Persistent volume claim',

00:55.590 --> 00:58.660
'Config map', 'Deployment services' and

00:58.660 --> 01:00.750
'User Management Microservice deployment'

01:00.750 --> 01:02.580
and then it's equal in service

01:02.580 --> 01:05.370
and also the secrets required for those things.

01:05.370 --> 01:09.840
Okay, so now let's go ahead and then verify the stuff.

01:09.840 --> 01:14.840
Okay, so 'Cube CTL', 'Get ports', 'Hyphen N', DEV-3'

01:14.880 --> 01:16.620
which is nothing but in 'DEV-3'

01:16.620 --> 01:18.120
and then keep watching it, okay?

01:18.120 --> 01:20.010
Till those things are completed.

01:20.010 --> 01:23.190
So now my scale is up and running, right?

01:23.190 --> 01:25.770
So which means my scale port is done.

01:25.770 --> 01:28.320
And then finally initialization means

01:28.320 --> 01:31.350
like that it verifies for the MYA scale is a partner

01:31.350 --> 01:33.960
that container has run and then completed.

01:33.960 --> 01:37.980
And then 'User Management Microservice' also got created.

01:37.980 --> 01:40.440
Okay, so finally my scale is run ready

01:40.440 --> 01:42.270
and then 'User Management' is also running

01:42.270 --> 01:44.160
and then it is waiting for its liveness,

01:44.160 --> 01:46.500
And then readiness probe checks are going to happen

01:46.500 --> 01:49.020
for 60 seconds. It is going to wait, right?

01:49.020 --> 01:51.750
So there it is waiting currently.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.670
We can see here after 90 seconds

01:53.670 --> 01:57.090
when the 'User Management Microservices' open, running here.

01:57.090 --> 02:01.930
Okay, so now let me say 'Control-C', 'Clear',

02:01.930 --> 02:04.060
'Q-CTL', 'Get port's

02:04.060 --> 02:06.690
'Hyphen N', 'DEV-3' directly.

02:06.690 --> 02:08.550
And all should be running now, okay.

02:08.550 --> 02:10.950
My scale is running and then User Management is running,

02:10.950 --> 02:13.800
no restarts, everything worked as expected.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.891
So now we need to go ahead and then view the

02:16.891 --> 02:18.960
YAML output of these things, okay.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.313
So for that you are going to say 'Cube CTL',

02:21.313 --> 02:25.590
'Get port' and the pod name and then 'Hyphen 0' YAML

02:25.590 --> 02:28.140
and then 'Hyphen N', 'DEV-3' namespace.

02:28.140 --> 02:30.210
Okay, so let's go ahead and do that

02:30.210 --> 02:31.043
'Q-CTL',

02:31.043 --> 02:31.876
(typing)

02:31.876 --> 02:33.273
'Get port's', okay?

02:34.140 --> 02:37.080
And then 'Get port', okay.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.850
And provide that port name

02:38.850 --> 02:42.630
which is nothing but My SQL, right?

02:42.630 --> 02:45.720
And 'Hyphen 0', 'YAML'.

02:45.720 --> 02:48.750
And where this part is located is L3.

02:48.750 --> 02:51.330
So now you'll get that YAML output of it.

02:51.330 --> 02:54.183
So now we are getting the, we got My SQL.

02:54.183 --> 02:58.200
YAML output, okay, so let's go up, go up, go up.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.690
So now you can see for the MYA scale also

03:00.690 --> 03:03.570
you have the resources defined by default

03:03.570 --> 03:05.700
for this MYA scale container.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.760
So in each spec you can see this is the MYA scale container

03:08.760 --> 03:13.760
right? So, so all this in namespace 'DEV-3'

03:13.800 --> 03:15.390
you can see resource information

03:15.390 --> 03:18.570
for that is also added in the container spec definition.

03:18.570 --> 03:21.300
Okay, so in the container, this is the spec

03:21.300 --> 03:23.340
and then containers you have the environment,

03:23.340 --> 03:25.350
you have the image, image pool policy,

03:25.350 --> 03:27.600
name of your container, 'My SQL'

03:27.600 --> 03:30.240
and the ports you have and resources section

03:30.240 --> 03:34.410
automatically added whenever you added the limit range.

03:34.410 --> 03:36.750
So which means you have two containers inside that.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.190
You have verified for My SQL.

03:38.190 --> 03:40.710
You can also verify the same thing for other things.

03:40.710 --> 03:44.790
Okay? So, 'Group CTL', 'Get port's' 'Minus N', 'DEV-3"

03:44.790 --> 03:47.947
and 'Cube CTL', 'Get pod'.

03:47.947 --> 03:51.513
And then the board name is this one.

03:51.513 --> 03:52.346
(mouse clicking)

03:52.346 --> 03:54.990
And I'm going to say 'Hyphen O'

03:54.990 --> 03:56.820
and then I need that YAML output.

03:56.820 --> 04:01.290
And it is present namespace 'DEV-3', right?

04:01.290 --> 04:05.043
So now again go up, go up, go up, up, up, up, up.

04:06.060 --> 04:08.250
See, now if you see here.

04:08.250 --> 04:11.880
So this is the image, okay, so where is it?

04:11.880 --> 04:14.430
Okay, so you can see the resources section

04:14.430 --> 04:18.450
for initiation DB also it has added these things.

04:18.450 --> 04:20.580
Okay, so now let's come down

04:20.580 --> 04:24.870
and also verify for our other container too, Okay.

04:24.870 --> 04:27.270
So it has terminated

04:27.270 --> 04:30.870
and whereabout what 'User Management' container.

04:30.870 --> 04:33.390
Okay, so it is the 'User Management' container.

04:33.390 --> 04:35.970
See we said it is per container.

04:35.970 --> 04:38.730
So in this we are going to run two containers, right?

04:38.730 --> 04:41.340
So one use initialization container which will wait

04:41.340 --> 04:44.040
for our respective DB2 up.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.410
And for that it associated the resources

04:46.410 --> 04:48.840
which is nothing but the in DB container.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.300
And also for the 'User Management' container.

04:51.300 --> 04:53.580
This is the 'User Management' container.

04:53.580 --> 04:55.890
And you can see 'Health status' and all this stuff.

04:55.890 --> 04:57.660
See this is the name of the User Management

04:57.660 --> 04:59.100
'Rest stop' container.

04:59.100 --> 05:02.640
And further down also you can see resources are associated.

05:02.640 --> 05:07.640
So this tells that whenever we associate the limit range

05:07.770 --> 05:11.010
for the namespace, all the containers present

05:11.010 --> 05:14.700
inside that namespace are going to get that default limits

05:14.700 --> 05:17.340
whatever we have defined here.

05:17.340 --> 05:20.460
So these are the limits we have defined and all those things

05:20.460 --> 05:23.850
are going to get for our all the containers present

05:23.850 --> 05:25.710
inside that namespace.

05:25.710 --> 05:27.870
So let's also see little bit about this.

05:27.870 --> 05:30.990
Limits means like 'get' and then describe the limits.

05:30.990 --> 05:33.030
Okay, so let me clear this.

05:33.030 --> 05:37.380
'Q-CTL', 'Get limits', 'Hyphen N', 'DEV-3'.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.660
So we have the limit, this is the limit name.

05:39.660 --> 05:44.190
So let's describe this limit, 'Q-CTL', describe limit

05:44.190 --> 05:46.290
and the limit name.

05:46.290 --> 05:48.000
Okay, so this is the limit name.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.420
Let me past it here and 'Hyphen N', 'DEV-3'.

05:51.420 --> 05:53.253
So let's see what it is, okay.

05:54.480 --> 05:58.740
What happened? "Doesn't have a resource type limit."

05:58.740 --> 06:01.350
So it should be 'limits', right?

06:01.350 --> 06:05.880
So slight mistake I have done here, it should be 'Limits'.

06:05.880 --> 06:06.713
Okay.

06:07.980 --> 06:11.220
So now you can see here the container CPU

06:11.220 --> 06:12.870
and then container memory, right?

06:12.870 --> 06:16.133
So default is 300 M and then 256 M.

06:17.220 --> 06:19.470
And default limit also whatever is there

06:19.470 --> 06:21.630
for this limit it is trying to show here.

06:21.630 --> 06:24.000
So whatever we have defined, the spec we are seeing

06:24.000 --> 06:27.450
in a visual manner, whatever we have defined it.

06:27.450 --> 06:30.450
So in addition to that, now if you want to test it.

06:30.450 --> 06:34.213
So we can access 'Cube CTL',

06:34.213 --> 06:35.580
okay, 'Get SVC'

06:35.580 --> 06:39.390
which is nothing but services in my iPhone and 'DEV-3'

06:39.390 --> 06:41.550
which is nothing but in 'DEV-3' namespace.

06:41.550 --> 06:45.000
So three, triple zero, two is my port, okay?

06:45.000 --> 06:48.630
So I need to go here and then update the portals.

06:48.630 --> 06:53.512
Three, triple zero, two and slash, okay.

06:53.512 --> 06:54.412
(typing)

06:54.412 --> 06:57.390
And then if I say 'Enter', ideally, it should come up.

06:57.390 --> 06:58.620
Okay, so it's coming up okay,

06:58.620 --> 07:01.350
with three triple zero two, it is coming.

07:01.350 --> 07:03.570
If you want we can even take the new tab

07:03.570 --> 07:06.690
and then paste it and then we'll get the response.

07:06.690 --> 07:09.180
Okay, so refreshed it and then we are getting it.

07:09.180 --> 07:13.110
Okay, so now we have even tested it, right?

07:13.110 --> 07:14.730
So now for cleanup, as usual

07:14.730 --> 07:16.410
if you want to delete your namespace

07:16.410 --> 07:19.140
you can delete it and then, delete storage class R.

07:19.140 --> 07:21.240
If you want you can delete via manifest.

07:21.240 --> 07:25.230
Okay, I'll say 'Q-CTL', 'Delete', 'Hyphen FQ' manifest

07:25.230 --> 07:27.390
with single command it will be done.

07:27.390 --> 07:29.550
So my namespace is deleted limit range.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.890
All the objects, whatever is present here

07:31.890 --> 07:34.110
are going to get deleted.

07:34.110 --> 07:36.180
So in our next lecture we'll focus

07:36.180 --> 07:38.520
on the resource quota concept.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.590
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

07:40.590 --> 07:41.850
Until then, bye bye.

07:41.850 --> 07:42.683
Thank you.
