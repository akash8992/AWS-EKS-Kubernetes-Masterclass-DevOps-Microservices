-: Welcome back.

00:01.500 --> 00:06.240
Step 04-07, "Uninstall AWS Load Balancer Controller

00:06.240 --> 00:07.980
Using Helm Command."

00:07.980 --> 00:12.360
So this command is put here for information purpose only.

00:12.360 --> 00:15.420
So we should not execute this command.

00:15.420 --> 00:19.080
So this command will uninstall the load balancer controller,

00:19.080 --> 00:22.380
whatever you have installed as part of previous step.

00:22.380 --> 00:24.210
So this is just to know that

00:24.210 --> 00:27.270
how to uninstall our load balancer controller

00:27.270 --> 00:29.940
using helm uninstall command.

00:29.940 --> 00:32.730
So for that purpose, for information purpose only,

00:32.730 --> 00:34.953
this step is put here.
