00:00.360 --> 00:01.530
Presenter: Welcome back.

00:01.530 --> 00:04.200
As part of step 06, we are going to review

00:04.200 --> 00:06.840
the IngressClass Kubernetes manifest,

00:06.840 --> 00:11.640
which is present in 0801 load balancer controller install.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.640
And inside that, you have the Kube manifest folder.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.473
And inside that,

00:15.473 --> 00:18.960
you have the 01 IngressClass resource.yaml.

00:18.960 --> 00:23.070
So let's go to our visual studio code here,

00:23.070 --> 00:28.070
and go to 08 new ELB application load balances.

00:28.350 --> 00:33.350
And inside that 0801 load balancer controller install,

00:33.390 --> 00:35.490
and inside that you'll find something called

00:35.490 --> 00:37.320
Kube Manifest folder.

00:37.320 --> 00:42.120
And there you'll find the 01 IngressClass resource.yaml.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.800
And we already discussed about this in the presentation

00:46.800 --> 00:50.460
also, API version, kind, metadata, and then spec.

00:50.460 --> 00:52.290
And here the API version is going

00:52.290 --> 00:57.290
to be networking.k8s.io/v1, and kind is IngressClass,

00:57.750 --> 01:01.282
and name of my IngressClass is, My AWS IngressClass.

01:01.282 --> 01:04.140
And in Spec, you'll have something called Controller,

01:04.140 --> 01:06.552
and you'll define your controller name as,

01:06.552 --> 01:10.050
or you'll define the controller this with spec 2

01:10.050 --> 01:11.460
IngressClass you are going to tie

01:11.460 --> 01:15.540
with is the AWS ALB Ingress controller,

01:15.540 --> 01:18.540
which is nothing but our AWS load balancer controller,

01:18.540 --> 01:19.890
you can save.

01:19.890 --> 01:22.200
And you also define the annotation

01:22.200 --> 01:27.000
ingressclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"

01:27.000 --> 01:29.580
so that any Ingress services deployed

01:29.580 --> 01:33.120
inside this Kubernetes cluster will be associated

01:33.120 --> 01:35.190
with the AWS load balancer controller

01:35.190 --> 01:38.640
whatever you have installed in the previous steps.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.980
So that's another important thing to know.

01:40.980 --> 01:42.810
So now let's come back here

01:42.810 --> 01:45.540
and deploy this Ingress resource.

01:45.540 --> 01:49.320
So we'll say Kubectl apply hyphen cube manifest

01:49.320 --> 01:50.640
so that anything present

01:50.640 --> 01:54.240
inside this Kube manifest folder will be deployed.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.820
So let's come back to our terminal here.

01:56.820 --> 02:00.744
We are in 0801 load balancer controller install

02:00.744 --> 02:04.410
and we'll say Kubectl,

02:04.410 --> 02:07.800
apply hyphen F and cube manifest slash.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.980
And this should create the IngressClass for us.

02:10.980 --> 02:14.580
So let's wait for the IngressClass to get created.

02:14.580 --> 02:17.430
So we can see IngressClass got created

02:17.430 --> 02:20.040
with name My AWS IngressClass.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.440
So now we are going to get the IngressClass

02:22.440 --> 02:25.200
and also describe the IngressClass.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.143
So Kubectl, get IngressClass,

02:29.220 --> 02:31.170
and we should see that AWS

02:31.170 --> 02:34.780
my AWS IngressClass got created successfully here.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.410
16 seconds before.

02:37.410 --> 02:38.650
And we'll also say

02:41.643 --> 02:43.476
Describe IngressClass.

02:46.650 --> 02:51.390
And its name is my AWS IngressClass.

02:51.390 --> 02:54.693
Kubectl describe IngressClass and my AWS IngressClass.

02:56.130 --> 02:58.950
And you can see name and annotation

02:58.950 --> 03:02.550
whatever you have specified and controller, whatever it has

03:02.550 --> 03:04.980
and events has nothing here.

03:04.980 --> 03:09.980
So this completes the creation of our installation

03:10.410 --> 03:15.410
of our setup of AWS load balancer controller on EKS cluster

03:16.350 --> 03:20.580
and also creating the IngressClass for and making it

03:20.580 --> 03:24.090
as the default IngressClass, a default Ingress controller

03:24.090 --> 03:27.660
for our Kubernetes using the IngressClass concept.

03:27.660 --> 03:29.670
So I'll see you in the next lecture

03:29.670 --> 03:33.101
or in the next section with Ingress basics.

03:33.101 --> 03:34.800
Until then, bye bye.

03:34.800 --> 03:35.633
Thank you.
