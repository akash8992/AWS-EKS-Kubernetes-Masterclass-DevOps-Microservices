00:00.240 --> 00:01.110
-: Welcome back.

00:01.110 --> 00:04.110
In this section we are going to create the internal

00:04.110 --> 00:08.880
application load balancer using Kubernetes ingress manifest.

00:08.880 --> 00:12.000
To do so, we are going to use the scheme,

00:12.000 --> 00:14.520
scheme annotation as internal.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.050
So if you remember, so

00:16.050 --> 00:19.530
for the internet facing related load balancer to create

00:19.530 --> 00:22.890
we have provided the scheme as internet facing.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.840
So now we will comment that part

00:24.840 --> 00:27.450
and add the scheme as internal so

00:27.450 --> 00:32.100
that it'll create the ingress ALB internal load balancer

00:32.100 --> 00:34.920
and to test this internal load balancer.

00:34.920 --> 00:35.753
Right?

00:35.753 --> 00:37.680
So we cannot connect to internal LB

00:37.680 --> 00:40.500
directly from internet two test it.

00:40.500 --> 00:44.010
So to do that we will deploy a curl part in EKS

00:44.010 --> 00:47.940
cluster so we can connect to curl POD in EKS cluster

00:47.940 --> 00:52.710
and test the internal LB endpoint using the curl command.

00:52.710 --> 00:54.970
And these are the series of commands we are

00:54.970 --> 00:58.050
going to use for curl testing.

00:58.050 --> 01:01.560
So first we will deploy the curl part and using

01:01.560 --> 01:03.720
the cube CTL exit command

01:03.720 --> 01:06.150
we will connect to that respective curl part.

01:06.150 --> 01:10.110
And from curl part we'll be able to run the curl commands.

01:10.110 --> 01:12.580
So we'll run the curl command for our default

01:13.650 --> 01:16.800
backend related use case and also for app one

01:16.800 --> 01:19.530
curl test and also app two curl test.

01:19.530 --> 01:21.720
We are going to run it in the next lecture.

01:21.720 --> 01:24.510
We are going to practically implement this and test it.

01:24.510 --> 01:26.040
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.120
Until then, bye bye.

01:27.120 --> 01:27.953
Thank you.
