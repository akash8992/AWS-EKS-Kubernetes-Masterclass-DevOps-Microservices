WEBVTT

00:00.630 --> 00:01.560
-: Welcome back.

00:01.560 --> 00:02.790
As part of step four,

00:02.790 --> 00:06.120
we are going to review or do a live template writing

00:06.120 --> 00:10.830
for our Ingress Kube manifest with default backend option.

00:10.830 --> 00:11.700
So we need to go

00:11.700 --> 00:15.570
into the file 01 Kube manifest default backend folder.

00:15.570 --> 00:19.113
And inside that 02 ALB Ingress basic.yaml.

00:19.980 --> 00:24.540
So let's go back here to our visual studio code,

00:24.540 --> 00:28.320
and we are in 802ALB Ingress basics,

00:28.320 --> 00:30.596
and inside that the folder

00:30.596 --> 00:33.630
is 01 Kube manifest default backend.

00:33.630 --> 00:36.750
And 01 nginx app1 deployment

00:36.750 --> 00:40.500
and note port service related Kubernetes manifest code,

00:40.500 --> 00:43.230
we already reviewed in the previous lecture.

00:43.230 --> 00:48.000
So now we will enter into 02 ALB Ingress basic.yaml.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.590
So the standard template here,

00:49.590 --> 00:53.160
API version, kind, metadata, and then spec.

00:53.160 --> 00:56.070
So for latest Ingress, right?

00:56.070 --> 00:58.560
So for the latest Ingress resources,

00:58.560 --> 01:03.493
so we need to use the API version as networking.k8s.io/v1.

01:04.980 --> 01:08.580
And whatever the kind Kubernetes object we are going

01:08.580 --> 01:11.550
to create here is Ingress.

01:11.550 --> 01:13.260
And in the metadata we are going

01:13.260 --> 01:17.010
to provide the name of my Ingress service

01:17.010 --> 01:21.573
and my Ingress service name is ingress-nginxapp1.

01:22.470 --> 01:26.100
And I'm also going to define labels here

01:26.100 --> 01:30.380
and I'm going to say it as app equal to app1 nginx.

01:31.380 --> 01:33.000
So this is purely optional.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.490
We really don't need to even define the label

01:35.490 --> 01:37.770
for my service here.

01:37.770 --> 01:39.660
So now let's come back here

01:39.660 --> 01:41.280
and in the metadata itself,

01:41.280 --> 01:43.680
we will have something called annotations.

01:43.680 --> 01:46.080
If we go back to our presentation here,

01:46.080 --> 01:47.550
so in the Ingress manifest,

01:47.550 --> 01:50.430
the key items are Ingress annotations

01:50.430 --> 01:53.760
and in Ingress spec, Ingress class name definition

01:53.760 --> 01:57.120
and in Ingress spec, defining either Ingress routing rules

01:57.120 --> 01:58.950
or default backend.

01:58.950 --> 02:00.690
So now we are at this point

02:00.690 --> 02:03.240
where we are defining the load balancer settings

02:03.240 --> 02:07.770
which is nothing but defining the Ingress annotations.

02:07.770 --> 02:11.010
So I will say annotations

02:11.010 --> 02:14.040
and we'll start with the first annotation.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.930
So let's go back here

02:15.930 --> 02:18.990
and go to the annotations documentation

02:18.990 --> 02:20.907
and you'll find something called

02:20.907 --> 02:23.370
ALB Ingress load balancer name.

02:23.370 --> 02:26.430
So we'll provide the load balancer name here.

02:26.430 --> 02:28.860
And if you want to understand more about it,

02:28.860 --> 02:31.710
so open it in the new tab and you'll go there exactly.

02:31.710 --> 02:35.580
Specify the custom name to use for the load balancer name.

02:35.580 --> 02:38.880
So name longer than 32 characters will be treated

02:38.880 --> 02:40.320
as an error.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.600
So once defined on a single Ingress,

02:42.600 --> 02:46.140
it impacts every Ingress within the Ingress group.

02:46.140 --> 02:48.660
So the Ingress group is a different concept

02:48.660 --> 02:51.750
which we will see in upcoming sections,

02:51.750 --> 02:53.310
but for now we are going

02:53.310 --> 02:57.720
to just define a simple name forever load balancer, right?

02:57.720 --> 02:59.460
So let's come back here

02:59.460 --> 03:03.420
and define it as app1 Ingress, right?

03:03.420 --> 03:06.750
So this is the first setting of my annotations related

03:06.750 --> 03:08.130
to my load balancer.

03:08.130 --> 03:13.130
And another important thing is Ingress core setting.

03:13.170 --> 03:16.050
We call this as the Ingress core setting because,

03:16.050 --> 03:19.890
so this Ingress service should be a internal Ingress service

03:19.890 --> 03:22.590
or external Ingress service,

03:22.590 --> 03:25.860
which means this should be private load balancer

03:25.860 --> 03:27.660
or public load balancer.

03:27.660 --> 03:32.010
So that setting can be defined using something called

03:32.010 --> 03:35.370
in annotation, you'll find the scheme here, right?

03:35.370 --> 03:38.550
So go to the scheme here and specifies

03:38.550 --> 03:41.280
whether your load balancer will be internet facing

03:41.280 --> 03:43.050
or internal, right?

03:43.050 --> 03:45.520
So let me copy this

03:47.370 --> 03:50.043
and define the scheme here.

03:51.570 --> 03:54.750
And it is going to be internet facing.

03:54.750 --> 03:58.500
So I'll say internet facing.

03:58.500 --> 04:03.500
You can also search for internet facing,

04:03.600 --> 04:06.930
see ALB Ingress Kubernetes cyber scheme internal

04:06.930 --> 04:08.370
or internet facing.

04:08.370 --> 04:10.800
So I N T E R N E T, internet facing.

04:10.800 --> 04:11.910
So this is good.

04:11.910 --> 04:14.760
And there will be one more annotation

04:14.760 --> 04:17.370
which we need to discuss in detail.

04:17.370 --> 04:20.400
But first we'll define the health check settings.

04:20.400 --> 04:23.370
So we have defined the load balancer name, scheme

04:23.370 --> 04:26.010
and we can also define the health check settings

04:26.010 --> 04:29.820
for our application load balancer here.

04:29.820 --> 04:33.960
So let's go here and go to the health check here

04:33.960 --> 04:36.090
and you'll find the health check setting related

04:36.090 --> 04:37.410
all annotations here.

04:37.410 --> 04:39.300
The first one is protocol,

04:39.300 --> 04:41.520
health check protocol you want to use,

04:41.520 --> 04:44.520
and I'll put it as HTTP protocol I'm using.

04:44.520 --> 04:47.820
I can say this as health check setting.

04:47.820 --> 04:52.710
And this I can say as Ingress core setting.

04:52.710 --> 04:57.710
And this one I can say as load balancer name, right?

04:59.610 --> 05:02.580
And the first setting for health check is completed.

05:02.580 --> 05:06.813
And next one we are going to define is traffic port, right?

05:08.783 --> 05:10.890
On which port it need to do the health check?

05:10.890 --> 05:13.140
It is going to be traffic port.

05:13.140 --> 05:16.470
And another setting is health check path, right?

05:16.470 --> 05:19.170
And my health check path is going to be,

05:19.170 --> 05:21.030
so let me put this here,

05:21.030 --> 05:25.860
and is going to be app1/index.html

05:25.860 --> 05:29.490
Where my application related files are present, right?

05:29.490 --> 05:32.370
index.html of my nginx is present

05:32.370 --> 05:35.460
in the app1 folder so I'll use that.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.220
And next one, right?

05:38.220 --> 05:42.180
So let me enter and let me come back here.

05:42.180 --> 05:46.500
And next one is going to be health check interval seconds.

05:46.500 --> 05:51.500
And I can give that as 15 seconds and let me put that.

05:53.730 --> 05:57.660
And I'll also provide the health check timeout, right?

05:57.660 --> 06:00.670
I can provide that as something around five

06:01.830 --> 06:03.210
and in seconds.

06:03.210 --> 06:05.880
And we can also provide the success quotes

06:05.880 --> 06:09.210
and then healthy thresholds and all those things.

06:09.210 --> 06:11.250
So we can provide a single value

06:11.250 --> 06:13.906
or we can provide multi value, right?

06:13.906 --> 06:16.980
200. 201 to 300, like this,

06:16.980 --> 06:18.630
we can provide those things.

06:18.630 --> 06:20.860
And I'll also provide the threshold count

06:22.080 --> 06:25.830
and also I'll provide the unhealthy threshold count.

06:25.830 --> 06:29.580
So this completes the health check setting definitions

06:29.580 --> 06:32.670
for my respective to Ingress resource.

06:32.670 --> 06:34.860
I have defined the load balancer name

06:34.860 --> 06:37.950
and where this load balancer should be placed internal

06:37.950 --> 06:41.910
or internet facing and also health check settings here.

06:41.910 --> 06:43.800
So now let's come back here

06:43.800 --> 06:46.380
and review one more thing here, right?

06:46.380 --> 06:49.290
So this is the app1index.html.

06:49.290 --> 06:52.230
So this Ingress is nothing but a combination

06:52.230 --> 06:54.960
of multiple applications you can send that traffic to.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.850
That's the core definition, right?

06:56.850 --> 07:00.240
So which means an application load balancer created

07:00.240 --> 07:05.240
for using a single load balancer you can send traffic

07:05.520 --> 07:07.980
to multiple applications with different schemes

07:07.980 --> 07:11.190
like using context path based or host header based

07:11.190 --> 07:12.570
and all those things.

07:12.570 --> 07:16.590
In cases like now, you have only one application here.

07:16.590 --> 07:18.510
So that's the reason you can define this

07:18.510 --> 07:21.510
as a global app1index.html,

07:21.510 --> 07:22.800
but in this Ingress,

07:22.800 --> 07:24.870
you are using the context part based routing,

07:24.870 --> 07:27.540
how we have discussed about accounts, products,

07:27.540 --> 07:28.740
and root context.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.560
And at that point of time in each application,

07:31.560 --> 07:33.630
there might not be a /app1

07:33.630 --> 07:36.960
and then index.html related things available

07:36.960 --> 07:38.010
for health check.

07:38.010 --> 07:39.360
So at that point of time,

07:39.360 --> 07:41.040
we need to move these things,

07:41.040 --> 07:43.800
this respect you thing, right,

07:43.800 --> 07:46.350
directly to your node port service so that,

07:46.350 --> 07:48.660
that becomes a service level one see.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.100
So now if you see here,

07:50.100 --> 07:53.700
need to add health check path annotation in service level.

07:53.700 --> 07:56.040
If you're planning to use multiple targets

07:56.040 --> 07:57.570
in a load balancer.

07:57.570 --> 07:59.010
Multiple targets are nothing

07:59.010 --> 08:02.160
but you are using multiple rules to define

08:02.160 --> 08:04.200
and then add multiple things here,

08:04.200 --> 08:05.670
means like you're sending the traffic

08:05.670 --> 08:09.180
from a single Ingress service to multiple applications.

08:09.180 --> 08:12.300
At that point of time you move your health check path,

08:12.300 --> 08:14.910
off your respective thing from global,

08:14.910 --> 08:18.330
from global Ingress setting to you are service level,

08:18.330 --> 08:21.150
node port service level thing, you need to move there.

08:21.150 --> 08:24.750
So now let's come back here and then come back to the spec.

08:24.750 --> 08:28.470
So we have completed the annotations part here

08:28.470 --> 08:31.560
and now we need to define the Ingress class name.

08:31.560 --> 08:34.810
So let's define the Ingress class name here

08:39.900 --> 08:43.220
And I'll say Ingress class name.

08:45.180 --> 08:47.070
And in Ingress class name,

08:47.070 --> 08:49.260
we are going to get the Ingress class name

08:49.260 --> 08:52.470
from our 0 8 0 1 Kube manifest

08:52.470 --> 08:56.070
and get this value from here.

08:56.070 --> 08:58.830
Let's come back and provide this.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.210
And the next thing is,

09:00.210 --> 09:03.871
we also need to provide the default backend here.

09:03.871 --> 09:05.490
And in default backend,

09:05.490 --> 09:08.220
we need to provide the service information

09:08.220 --> 09:10.440
and in service the name of the service,

09:10.440 --> 09:12.060
we need to provide

09:12.060 --> 09:13.590
and name of the service,

09:13.590 --> 09:16.890
we can get from our 01 nginx.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.030
And here is the name

09:18.030 --> 09:22.200
of the node port service we need to define here, right?

09:22.200 --> 09:25.590
And we also need to define the port

09:25.590 --> 09:30.590
and we'll say the number as 80.

09:30.870 --> 09:35.520
So this completes the definition of your Ingress service.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.700
And another important thing to discuss here is,

09:38.700 --> 09:40.470
so let's come back here

09:40.470 --> 09:44.430
and go to the Ingress class documentation

09:44.430 --> 09:47.520
and you'll discuss about it deprecated annotation.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.350
One important annotation.

09:49.350 --> 09:52.230
So you can say ALB

09:52.230 --> 09:57.230
or I can say kubernetes.io/ingress.class.

10:08.070 --> 10:12.180
So this is the earlier annotation which we used to use

10:12.180 --> 10:14.340
and it is widely implemented

10:14.340 --> 10:18.270
across all the Ingress resources or Ingress controllers.

10:18.270 --> 10:20.610
So let's come back here,

10:20.610 --> 10:24.540
see deprecated kubernetes.io/ingress.class annotation.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.640
So before the Ingress class resource

10:26.640 --> 10:30.390
and Ingress class name field were added in Kubernetes 1.18.

10:30.390 --> 10:34.350
So Ingress classes were specified with this name, right?

10:34.350 --> 10:37.260
So the newer is Ingress class name field

10:37.260 --> 10:39.390
whatever we have added here, right?

10:39.390 --> 10:40.590
So let's come back here.

10:40.590 --> 10:41.760
And this is the one.

10:41.760 --> 10:46.760
So already you have defined it as a default controller,

10:46.830 --> 10:49.980
means like you are Ingress AWS ALB controller.

10:49.980 --> 10:52.260
You have defined it as a default controller

10:52.260 --> 10:54.180
with this respective setting.

10:54.180 --> 10:56.340
So which means you really don't need

10:56.340 --> 10:58.530
to even define this also.

10:58.530 --> 11:01.380
Why, because you already have a default controller

11:01.380 --> 11:05.310
which is Ingress controller in your Kubernetes cluster.

11:05.310 --> 11:06.330
And then you don't need

11:06.330 --> 11:08.790
to specify the Ingress class name here.

11:08.790 --> 11:11.700
But just for notation and to understand for us,

11:11.700 --> 11:14.700
I have defined it here and let's come back here.

11:14.700 --> 11:16.410
So the newer Ingress class name field

11:16.410 --> 11:19.530
and Ingress is replacement for that respect to annotation

11:19.530 --> 11:22.560
which is kubernetes.io/ingress.class,

11:22.560 --> 11:25.110
but is not a direct equivalent.

11:25.110 --> 11:27.270
While the annotation was generally used to

11:27.270 --> 11:29.850
reference the name of Ingress controllers

11:29.850 --> 11:31.620
that should implement the Ingress.

11:31.620 --> 11:34.110
The field is a reference to an Ingress class resource

11:34.110 --> 11:36.360
that contains additional Ingress configurations

11:36.360 --> 11:39.000
including the name of the Ingress controller.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.910
In simple terms, in very, very simple terms.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.920
So this is now a optional thing

11:43.920 --> 11:45.480
whether we want to use it or not.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.150
So if you use it or if you don't use it,

11:48.150 --> 11:50.790
there is no harm for us as on today.

11:50.790 --> 11:54.660
But why do we need to use a deprecated annotation

11:54.660 --> 11:57.870
in our latest Ingress manifest?

11:57.870 --> 11:59.130
So that's the reason,

11:59.130 --> 12:02.130
I didn't define any Ingress class right?

12:02.130 --> 12:06.900
Kubernetes.io/ingress.class here, right?

12:06.900 --> 12:09.510
We are directly using the Ingress class name

12:09.510 --> 12:11.340
and referencing to the Ingress class,

12:11.340 --> 12:13.050
whatever we have created

12:13.050 --> 12:17.400
in our load balancer install related section.

12:17.400 --> 12:21.870
So this completes the review and our live template writing

12:21.870 --> 12:25.440
of our Ingress resource with that default back end.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.490
So in our next lecture,

12:26.490 --> 12:28.830
we are going to deploy this send then test it.

12:28.830 --> 12:30.240
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.350
Until then, bye bye.

12:31.350 --> 12:32.183
Thank you.
