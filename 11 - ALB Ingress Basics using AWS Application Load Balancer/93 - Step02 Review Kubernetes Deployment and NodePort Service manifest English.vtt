00:00.450 --> 00:01.470
-: Welcome back.

00:01.470 --> 00:04.260
Let's go back to our GitHub repository

00:04.260 --> 00:08.790
and we are in 0802 ALB Ingress basics.

00:08.790 --> 00:10.860
And as part of step one,

00:10.860 --> 00:14.340
we already understood about what we are going to implement

00:14.340 --> 00:16.440
as part of this section.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.780
So now we are in step two where we are going

00:18.780 --> 00:23.220
to review the app one deployment Kubernetes manifest.

00:23.220 --> 00:24.450
So we need to go

00:24.450 --> 00:28.290
to zero one kube manifest default backend folder.

00:28.290 --> 00:31.260
So if you go back to our Visual Studio code here,

00:31.260 --> 00:35.670
in 0802 and in ALB Ingress basics.

00:35.670 --> 00:37.110
So you'll have the demo one

00:37.110 --> 00:40.260
which is zero one kube manifest default backend,

00:40.260 --> 00:41.763
and you'll have the demo two,

00:42.948 --> 00:44.700
which is zero two kube manifest rules.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.320
So if you go inside this,

00:46.320 --> 00:49.680
we'll find something called zero one Nginx app

00:49.680 --> 00:52.650
one deployment and then node port service.

00:52.650 --> 00:56.280
So this is our standard deployment and node port service.

00:56.280 --> 00:58.110
So we will review on a high level

00:58.110 --> 01:00.420
and then move on to the next step.

01:00.420 --> 01:03.510
So, if you see here APA version is apps V1

01:03.510 --> 01:06.090
and kind is deployment and metadata

01:06.090 --> 01:09.630
is app one Nginx deployment, right?

01:09.630 --> 01:12.030
And in the spec you have replicas.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.890
We are going to create one port

01:13.890 --> 01:15.660
and in selector match labels

01:15.660 --> 01:20.660
you have provided the label as app equal to app one Nginx.

01:21.240 --> 01:25.950
The same we are going to use in our node port service.

01:25.950 --> 01:27.750
We'll see that later.

01:27.750 --> 01:30.930
And in template you have the metadata label

01:30.930 --> 01:32.700
app app one Nginx.

01:32.700 --> 01:37.367
And in deployment spec and inside that template

01:37.367 --> 01:40.290
and in template you'll have the pod specification

01:40.290 --> 01:41.670
and you have the containers.

01:41.670 --> 01:43.080
And inside the containers,

01:43.080 --> 01:45.870
the first container you have defined inside this port

01:45.870 --> 01:47.753
is app one Nginx

01:47.753 --> 01:50.070
and you are bringing the container

01:50.070 --> 01:55.070
from stacksimplify/kube Nginx app one 1.0.0

01:55.134 --> 01:58.740
and ports we are going to use the container port S80.

01:58.740 --> 02:02.130
So this is the deployment manifest

02:02.130 --> 02:04.440
and here is the node port service.

02:04.440 --> 02:09.030
And in node port service you can see API version is V1

02:09.030 --> 02:11.610
and kind is service.

02:11.610 --> 02:15.360
And in metadata you'll find app one Nginx node port service

02:15.360 --> 02:18.960
is the name of this service and inspect, right?

02:18.960 --> 02:21.930
So let's ignore these labels and annotations for now.

02:21.930 --> 02:24.240
So let's come back to the service spec.

02:24.240 --> 02:27.330
And you are saying that service type has node port

02:27.330 --> 02:31.110
and selector label you can see app app one Nginx,

02:31.110 --> 02:32.550
the same whatever you have seen

02:32.550 --> 02:36.300
in the selector match labels of your deployment.

02:36.300 --> 02:38.130
So which means any traffic coming

02:38.130 --> 02:41.010
to this app one Nginx node port service

02:41.010 --> 02:42.810
will be sent to the ports

02:42.810 --> 02:45.720
with this app app one Nginx

02:45.720 --> 02:49.350
match labels related ports, right?

02:49.350 --> 02:51.840
So which means it'll send to this ports

02:51.840 --> 02:55.020
created by this respective deployment.

02:55.020 --> 02:58.470
So, now let's come back here and see the ports.

02:58.470 --> 03:00.762
The service port is port 80

03:00.762 --> 03:02.160
and the target port,

03:02.160 --> 03:06.150
which is nothing but your port of your port

03:06.150 --> 03:08.190
is also port 80,

03:08.190 --> 03:11.370
or you can say that container port is 80.

03:11.370 --> 03:13.170
So now let's come back

03:13.170 --> 03:15.030
and we have successfully reviewed

03:15.030 --> 03:18.300
our Nginx app one deployment and node port service.

03:18.300 --> 03:19.440
In our our next lecture,

03:19.440 --> 03:22.740
we are going to go ahead and then do a live template writing

03:22.740 --> 03:26.580
for our ALB Ingress, right, manifest,

03:26.580 --> 03:29.880
which is zero two ALB Ingress basic.yaml.

03:29.880 --> 03:31.560
So, I'll see you in the next lecture.

03:31.560 --> 03:32.790
Until then, bye bye.

03:32.790 --> 03:33.623
Thank you.
