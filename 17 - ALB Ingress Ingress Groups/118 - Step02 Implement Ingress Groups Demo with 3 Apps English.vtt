WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:01.290
-: Welcome back.

00:01.290 --> 00:03.880
Let's go to the GitHub repository now

00:04.770 --> 00:09.330
and go into the section zero eight 12 Ingress groups.

00:09.330 --> 00:12.750
And in Ingress groups, as part of introductory section,

00:12.750 --> 00:15.750
we already understood what we are going to implement

00:15.750 --> 00:17.730
as part of this section.

00:17.730 --> 00:19.350
So let's go to step two.

00:19.350 --> 00:22.710
Which is review app one Ingress manifest.

00:22.710 --> 00:25.410
So let's go back to our visual studio code here.

00:25.410 --> 00:28.200
And in zero eight 12 in Ingress groups,

00:28.200 --> 00:30.270
you have a cube manifest folder.

00:30.270 --> 00:32.310
And inside that you have app one, app two,

00:32.310 --> 00:33.690
and then app three.

00:33.690 --> 00:35.400
So we'll start with app one,

00:35.400 --> 00:38.511
and in app one zero one Nginx app one deployment

00:38.511 --> 00:40.320
and note port service.

00:40.320 --> 00:44.040
So no changes in this as usual from the previous sections.

00:44.040 --> 00:47.130
And for zero two app one Ingress, right?

00:47.130 --> 00:50.190
So if you see here in zero two app one Ingress.

00:50.190 --> 00:53.850
The first thing changes name of my Ingress resource.

00:53.850 --> 00:56.580
It is app one Ingress.

00:56.580 --> 00:57.960
And my load balancer name

00:57.960 --> 01:01.320
is going to be Ingress groups demo.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.720
And now let's come down here.

01:03.720 --> 01:06.990
And this are the Ingress groups, we are going to define.

01:06.990 --> 01:08.880
So two annotations for Ingress group,

01:08.880 --> 01:12.480
which is group.name and group.order.

01:12.480 --> 01:15.660
And in the group.name, we are giving them myapps.web.

01:15.660 --> 01:19.860
And group.order, I'm giving them 10 as the number.

01:19.860 --> 01:22.800
And I am only providing one rule here,

01:22.800 --> 01:25.590
which is slash app one.

01:25.590 --> 01:28.860
So in this Ingress, I have only one rule.

01:28.860 --> 01:31.890
But in this app one application, you have hundred rules.

01:31.890 --> 01:35.580
So define all your hundred rules related to your application

01:35.580 --> 01:37.890
and implement them here, right?

01:37.890 --> 01:40.440
So this is only for my app one.

01:40.440 --> 01:43.170
And now let's go to app two.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.780
And no changes in app two deployment

01:45.780 --> 01:49.260
and note port service as usual the same content.

01:49.260 --> 01:51.300
And for zero to app two Ingress.

01:51.300 --> 01:53.460
So if you see here on the top.

01:53.460 --> 01:57.390
So the name of my Ingress resources app two Ingress.

01:57.390 --> 01:59.507
But the load balancer name,

01:59.507 --> 02:03.390
as usual it is the same thing from app funding results,

02:03.390 --> 02:04.500
Ingress groups demo.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.550
Why because it is going

02:05.550 --> 02:08.760
to create a single application load balancer for us

02:08.760 --> 02:11.670
and its name is going to be Ingress Groups demo.

02:11.670 --> 02:15.330
And all these things you need to group with group name,

02:15.330 --> 02:17.550
Ingress group name my app start web.

02:17.550 --> 02:21.240
And this is the app two and it's rule priorities port 20.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.970
And you have the part of slash app two

02:23.970 --> 02:25.620
for this respect to application,

02:25.620 --> 02:29.070
which goes to app two Nginx note port service.

02:29.070 --> 02:32.220
And now let's go to app three here.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.920
And zero one Nginx app three deployment

02:34.920 --> 02:37.020
and note port service, no changes in it.

02:37.020 --> 02:40.200
We'll leave as is and we'll go to app three here.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.690
And you see the name is app three Ingress

02:42.690 --> 02:46.230
and LB Ingress load balancer name cms previous app one,

02:46.230 --> 02:48.510
and app two, which is Ingress groups demo.

02:48.510 --> 02:53.510
And these this also belongs to my apps.web Ingress group

02:54.480 --> 02:56.550
and the group order is 30.

02:56.550 --> 02:59.370
And here you have the default backend.

02:59.370 --> 03:04.370
So now let's go back here and go to the next step,

03:04.710 --> 03:06.840
which is deploy apps with two.

03:06.840 --> 03:09.900
These two are three Ingress resources and then verify.

03:09.900 --> 03:10.980
So this should be three.

03:10.980 --> 03:12.120
So that's fine.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.900
So Cube CTL apply hyphen R, hyphen F.

03:15.900 --> 03:19.080
So what this hyphen capital R does is.

03:19.080 --> 03:23.760
So whatever the sub folders present in cube manifest, right?

03:23.760 --> 03:26.700
So cube manifests present inside the folders

03:26.700 --> 03:29.850
of cube manifest, also will be deployed.

03:29.850 --> 03:32.910
Which means all these sub folders app one app two app three.

03:32.910 --> 03:34.890
So re cast your folders, whatever is there.

03:34.890 --> 03:39.480
From them also the Kubernetes Alma files will be deployed.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.700
So let's go to the terminal here

03:41.700 --> 03:44.640
and go into the section zero eight 12.

03:44.640 --> 03:48.480
So we are in zero eight new ELB application load balances

03:48.480 --> 03:52.650
and we are into C A CD zero eight 12 Ingress groups.

03:52.650 --> 03:57.650
And I'm going to say Cube CTL, apply hyphen F and hyphen R.

03:59.100 --> 04:02.220
And I'm going to provide that cube manifest.

04:02.220 --> 04:05.790
Or you can just say, this is one way of doing it.

04:05.790 --> 04:09.750
Or you can remove cube CTL, apply hyphen F

04:09.750 --> 04:11.910
cube manifest app one.

04:11.910 --> 04:13.800
And once this is deployed app two

04:13.800 --> 04:15.600
and that is deployed after that app three.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.610
So like this also you can try.

04:17.610 --> 04:22.610
So we will go with cube CTL apply hyphen F

04:22.770 --> 04:24.840
and hyphen R cube manifest.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.630
So that all the things will be deployed.

04:27.630 --> 04:32.630
So we'll start with Cube CTL, apply hyphen R

04:32.820 --> 04:34.503
hyphen F cube manifest.

04:35.430 --> 04:36.660
What happened?

04:36.660 --> 04:41.660
Space Cube CTL space apply hyphen R, hyphen F cube manifest.

04:43.170 --> 04:44.003
Good.

04:44.003 --> 04:46.740
So this should deploy all the things for us.

04:46.740 --> 04:50.010
So now let's go back here and for all these things,

04:50.010 --> 04:53.790
another common thing you can see here is external DNS name.

04:53.790 --> 04:57.720
So Ingress groups demo six zero one stacksimplify.com

04:57.720 --> 04:59.040
in app for Ingress.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.420
And in app to Ingress also,

05:00.420 --> 05:03.060
you'll see that same name, right?

05:03.060 --> 05:06.840
In app three Ingress also, you can see it's the same name.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.240
So now let's come out of this, right?

05:09.240 --> 05:10.950
Minimize these things.

05:10.950 --> 05:14.430
Close and come back here to the terminal.

05:14.430 --> 05:17.730
And you can see app one, app two, app three related

05:17.730 --> 05:22.140
deployment 10 note port service created, and also app one,

05:22.140 --> 05:23.070
app two, and app three.

05:23.070 --> 05:24.450
App one Ingress created.

05:24.450 --> 05:27.810
App two Ingress created and app three Ingress created.

05:27.810 --> 05:32.220
So now if you say Cube CTL get ports should say that

05:32.220 --> 05:34.230
all app one, app two, app three ports

05:34.230 --> 05:36.150
you can see here running.

05:36.150 --> 05:38.130
And also you can see the services.

05:38.130 --> 05:41.220
App one, app two, app three note port services

05:41.220 --> 05:42.870
also you can see.

05:42.870 --> 05:43.740
Let's clear this.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.540
Now the important thing is.

05:45.540 --> 05:49.740
Very important command is Cube CTL get Ingress.

05:49.740 --> 05:53.250
And under this whatever you see is the very important thing.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.800
So it has created three resources app,

05:55.800 --> 05:59.400
one Ingress, app two Ingress and app three Ingress.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.220
So it created three Ingress resources.

06:02.220 --> 06:03.990
But if you see here.

06:03.990 --> 06:07.530
It is referencing to a single, right?

06:07.530 --> 06:09.900
Single address here Ingress groups demo

06:09.900 --> 06:12.540
one six three six one zero four seven eight .

06:12.540 --> 06:15.000
So this is same for all three things.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.680
Which means it is referencing

06:16.680 --> 06:20.160
to a single application load balancer.

06:20.160 --> 06:23.130
So now let's come back here and verify.

06:23.130 --> 06:26.070
So we have verified three Ingress resources will be created

06:26.070 --> 06:27.480
with same address value.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.800
We have verified that.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.140
So three Ingress resources are merged to create

06:31.140 --> 06:34.320
a single application load balancer.

06:34.320 --> 06:38.033
So now go to the load balancer and verify the same thing.

06:38.033 --> 06:42.450
So we'll refresh here in the EC two load balancer section.

06:42.450 --> 06:45.690
And now if you see Ingress groups demo,

06:45.690 --> 06:47.472
a single load balancer is created,

06:47.472 --> 06:50.640
and it is currently in the provisioning state.

06:50.640 --> 06:53.220
So let's wait for it to provision.

06:53.220 --> 06:57.998
And in meantime we can go here and verify our external DNS,

06:57.998 --> 07:01.110
whatever it has registered here.

07:01.110 --> 07:04.590
So it should be something related to Ingress groups demo

07:04.590 --> 07:07.110
601.stacksimplifiy.com.

07:07.110 --> 07:08.250
So that is good.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.980
So I can copy this, and I can come back here,

07:10.980 --> 07:15.283
and verify that, and let's look up for that, right?

07:15.283 --> 07:17.160
And it is authoritative.

07:17.160 --> 07:18.930
So it is working.

07:18.930 --> 07:22.410
So now let me clear this and wait for the load balancer

07:22.410 --> 07:25.200
to be in the active state.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.170
So we can see here our load balancer is in active state.

07:28.170 --> 07:29.550
We'll go to listeners,

07:29.550 --> 07:32.760
and we'll go to the four four three related listeners,

07:32.760 --> 07:35.580
and then click on view all edit rules.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.220
So you can see it has created a rule one,

07:38.220 --> 07:39.810
which is slash app one.

07:39.810 --> 07:43.010
So which goes to the default app one Nginx

07:43.010 --> 07:45.120
related note port service.

07:45.120 --> 07:47.790
Which is nothing but it created a target group

07:47.790 --> 07:49.470
app one Nginx related.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.213
And for app two,

07:51.213 --> 07:53.790
it is app two Nginx related target group created.

07:53.790 --> 07:57.390
And default backend, it is going to app three Nginx.

07:57.390 --> 08:00.180
So all three rules created with priority one two

08:00.180 --> 08:02.400
and this one is at the last.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.980
And now let's come back here and if you want,

08:04.980 --> 08:06.960
we can go and then access them.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.730
Same thing via browser.

08:08.730 --> 08:12.540
So we are just implemented the Ingress groups concept,

08:12.540 --> 08:16.320
and we have created three Ingress resources, and

08:16.320 --> 08:18.330
from three Ingress resources also.

08:18.330 --> 08:19.410
All those things, right?

08:19.410 --> 08:22.200
Get Ingress and all those things.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.610
Merge it together

08:23.610 --> 08:26.580
to create a single application load balancer.

08:26.580 --> 08:28.500
And we are testing that if it is going

08:28.500 --> 08:31.410
to work as expected or not.

08:31.410 --> 08:35.783
So we access it Ingress Groups demo 601.stacksimplify.com,

08:35.783 --> 08:40.783
app one is accessible, and we will also access app two

08:41.070 --> 08:43.020
and also app two is accessible.

08:43.020 --> 08:47.460
And finally we'll access the default one,

08:47.460 --> 08:50.392
which is Kubernetes Fundamentals

08:50.392 --> 08:51.810
demo application version three one.

08:51.810 --> 08:54.750
So all three apps are access accessible

08:54.750 --> 08:58.230
and our Ingress group demo is successful.

08:58.230 --> 09:01.470
So let's go there and then clean up the stuff now.

09:01.470 --> 09:03.750
So I'll say Cube CTL, delete hyphen R,

09:03.750 --> 09:05.550
hyphen F cube manifest.

09:05.550 --> 09:08.580
So all app one, app two and then app three related

09:08.580 --> 09:11.190
Kubernetes manifest will be undeployed.

09:11.190 --> 09:14.190
So let's wait for it to undeploy.

09:14.190 --> 09:16.920
We can see here all the resources got deleted.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.860
So let's go back here and refresh.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.290
And our Ingress resources should go away.

09:22.290 --> 09:26.006
And also we'll see the hosted zone stacksimplify.com

09:26.006 --> 09:28.770
and anything related to Ingress groups demo

09:28.770 --> 09:30.780
is not present now.

09:30.780 --> 09:33.780
So this completes the Ingress groups demo.

09:33.780 --> 09:35.220
I'll see you in the next section

09:35.220 --> 09:37.380
with another Ingress concept.

09:37.380 --> 09:38.520
Until then, bye bye.

09:38.520 --> 09:39.353
Thank you.
