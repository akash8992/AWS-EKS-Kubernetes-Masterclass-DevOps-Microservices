00:00.150 --> 00:00.990
-: Welcome back.

00:00.990 --> 00:03.090
In this lecture, we are going to install

00:03.090 --> 00:07.680
the EBS CSI driver on our Kubernetes cluster.

00:07.680 --> 00:11.370
So we are going to create an IAM policy for EBS

00:11.370 --> 00:15.840
and associate that IAM policy to our worker node, IAM role.

00:15.840 --> 00:19.140
And then install the EBS CSI driver.

00:19.140 --> 00:20.790
So once we create this role

00:20.790 --> 00:25.320
and then associate it to our EBS EC2 instances,

00:25.320 --> 00:29.640
things like EKS EC2 instances worker node IAM role,

00:29.640 --> 00:31.740
which means like the pods inside

00:31.740 --> 00:34.560
the Kubernetes will be able to access

00:34.560 --> 00:39.560
that respective EBS services from the Kubernetes cluster.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.910
So let's go ahead and then do that now.

00:41.910 --> 00:45.540
So go to Services IAM and then create a policy

00:45.540 --> 00:47.613
with following details.

00:50.490 --> 00:52.060
So let's copy this

00:53.414 --> 00:56.793
and then go to IAM Service.

01:03.090 --> 01:05.010
And then go to Policies,

01:05.010 --> 01:08.373
and then Create a Policy.

01:10.620 --> 01:13.620
And go to JSON and remove existing

01:13.620 --> 01:15.060
and then add this.

01:15.060 --> 01:17.010
And go to Visual Editor

01:17.010 --> 01:20.010
and it'll validate the entire policy here.

01:20.010 --> 01:21.810
And the following EC2 actions,

01:21.810 --> 01:23.730
it is going to pick as part of this,

01:23.730 --> 01:25.470
whatever the JSON we have copied,

01:25.470 --> 01:28.623
it has picked close to two well actions from EC2.

01:29.460 --> 01:33.660
And review policy and provide the name of the policy.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.670
So the name of the policy we are going to say

01:35.670 --> 01:38.883
is Amazon EBS CSI Driver.

01:40.080 --> 01:43.380
And even we can say that for EKS

01:43.380 --> 01:45.753
so that it looks good if you want.

01:48.035 --> 01:49.985
So you see the instance access for EKS.

01:51.690 --> 01:53.733
And then create a policy.

01:55.380 --> 01:57.240
So once the policy got created,

01:57.240 --> 01:59.550
get the IAM role worker node using

01:59.550 --> 02:02.160
an associate this policy to that role.

02:02.160 --> 02:06.240
So you can get your IAM roles on our EKS cluster

02:06.240 --> 02:07.080
using this command, kubectl.

02:07.080 --> 02:12.080
In the kube system namespace, describe configmap aws-auth

02:13.440 --> 02:15.510
so we can get this way.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.310
The one way of getting it is this way.

02:17.310 --> 02:19.620
So let me go to terminals.

02:19.620 --> 02:22.503
So I didn't have my terminal open.

02:23.494 --> 02:24.340
So let's go here

02:25.350 --> 02:27.723
and open the terminal.

02:32.160 --> 02:33.603
Make it bigger.

02:35.760 --> 02:40.080
And then let's space this kubectl-n kube system,

02:40.080 --> 02:42.270
which is in kube system namespace.

02:42.270 --> 02:44.890
Describe the configmap aws-auth

02:46.230 --> 02:48.660
and it should provide the role ARN

02:48.660 --> 02:50.520
So this is the role ARN.

02:50.520 --> 02:53.850
So which means need to search for this in the IAM.

02:53.850 --> 02:57.660
And then under this, we need to associate the policy,

02:57.660 --> 02:59.730
whatever we have created.

02:59.730 --> 03:01.530
So we are here now.

03:01.530 --> 03:05.580
And we can go to Roles and then search for that policy.

03:05.580 --> 03:07.710
So I have copied this

03:07.710 --> 03:11.400
and I have copied from eksctl here.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.260
So from here I have copied this.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.520
And then searching here,

03:14.520 --> 03:17.370
and then I got the policy role here.

03:17.370 --> 03:21.330
So inside this role, we can attach the policy.

03:21.330 --> 03:24.060
Attach. And I can say,

03:24.060 --> 03:26.730
Amazon EBS CSI driver.

03:26.730 --> 03:28.440
So this one we are going to attach

03:28.440 --> 03:31.830
to our worker node IAM role.

03:31.830 --> 03:34.080
So the other way of finding the rollies.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.063
So we can go to EC2.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.650
And in EC2, if you see here,

03:40.650 --> 03:42.690
we'll have the running instances.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.280
And in that we'll have our T3

03:44.280 --> 03:47.520
medium related EKS cluster related instances.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.760
If you see these are related to EKS demo cluster.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.710
So now, I can go here

03:52.710 --> 03:55.200
and then I'll find the IAM role here,

03:55.200 --> 03:57.360
So you can see, IAM role.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.340
So I can click on this directly

03:59.340 --> 04:01.383
and then associate if I want to.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.580
So if you see, already it is associated.

04:08.580 --> 04:10.020
Just now, we have associated.

04:10.020 --> 04:13.323
So this value and this value should be absolutely the same.

04:14.280 --> 04:18.360
So one K8 and one K8,

04:18.360 --> 04:20.130
So in both ways, we can go ahead

04:20.130 --> 04:23.010
and then identify our IAM role.

04:23.010 --> 04:26.280
So now, we have provided the equivalent permissions

04:26.280 --> 04:30.120
for our EC2 instances present in the EKS cluster.

04:30.120 --> 04:34.290
Now we can go ahead and then deploy the EBS CSI driver.

04:34.290 --> 04:36.450
So we should be 1.14 or later.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.913
So let's verify our version.

04:41.843 --> 04:44.070
So we are at 1.16.6 beta.

04:44.070 --> 04:45.090
So good.

04:45.090 --> 04:50.090
so now we are going to deploy the Amazon EBS CSI driver.

04:50.280 --> 04:53.940
So I'll copy this entire thing and then paste it.

04:53.940 --> 04:55.590
So it'll reference to the Kubernetes

04:55.590 --> 05:00.590
special interest groups AWS, EBS CSI driver GitHub repo.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.520
So I'm deploying it.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.830
So whatever is the latest as on today,

05:04.830 --> 05:07.683
it is going to deploy that version.

05:09.990 --> 05:11.433
So it'll take a while.

05:13.650 --> 05:15.330
So it is creating the cluster roles

05:15.330 --> 05:19.110
demonstrates all whatever is required, it has created.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.703
So what we can do is,

05:21.664 --> 05:23.313
I can say,

05:24.750 --> 05:29.743
get pods-n kube system.

05:31.740 --> 05:33.780
So this should be created in kube system.

05:33.780 --> 05:36.060
So let's crosscheck.

05:36.060 --> 05:40.020
So you can see it has created the EBS CSI controller

05:40.020 --> 05:42.750
and then EBS CSI nodes here.

05:42.750 --> 05:47.750
So I'll also add this there in our document.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.513
So it has created and then it is up and running.

05:53.028 --> 05:55.800
So in our next lecture, we'll focus on the next concept.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.180
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

05:57.180 --> 05:58.200
Until then, bye-bye.

05:58.200 --> 05:59.033
Thank you.
