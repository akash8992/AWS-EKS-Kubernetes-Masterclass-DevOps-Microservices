00:00.240 --> 00:01.073
-: Welcome back.

00:01.073 --> 00:03.510
In this step we are going to create MySQL database

00:03.510 --> 00:07.110
with all above manifests, whatever we have created, right?

00:07.110 --> 00:08.340
So we are going to create it

00:08.340 --> 00:11.370
and then verify the storage class, PVC, PV, pods

00:11.370 --> 00:13.800
and then also list the pods.

00:13.800 --> 00:16.830
And then connect to our respective MySQL database

00:16.830 --> 00:18.180
and then see the schemas.

00:18.180 --> 00:19.470
Okay?

00:19.470 --> 00:22.590
So let's go ahead and then do that now.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.140
So we are in our respective folder,

00:25.140 --> 00:30.000
which is nothing but a 0402 SCP SV config map MySQL, okay?

00:30.000 --> 00:34.740
So Kubectl apply hyphen "f" cube manifest.

00:34.740 --> 00:36.360
So whatever the manifest is under that

00:36.360 --> 00:37.530
it is going to create it.

00:37.530 --> 00:39.570
If any issues, it is going to throw the error

00:39.570 --> 00:41.910
and then we are going to know about it.

00:41.910 --> 00:44.490
So we know that under the cluster IP service,

00:44.490 --> 00:46.290
we have a validation error.

00:46.290 --> 00:49.620
I didn't provide Cluster, C L U S E R.

00:49.620 --> 00:51.330
I didn't provide that "T" here. Okay?

00:51.330 --> 00:55.050
So let's go there and then fix that, okay?

00:55.050 --> 00:58.680
So cluster IP, right?

00:58.680 --> 01:00.000
So that's good.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.580
So now let's try one more time.

01:02.580 --> 01:06.120
So it should get created and the service also got created.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.193
So now if you see the,

01:09.480 --> 01:13.290
get PVC persistent volume claim.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.540
So now it is bound, you can see, right?

01:15.540 --> 01:17.130
So earlier it is in pending state

01:17.130 --> 01:19.620
whenever we have directly created them.

01:19.620 --> 01:22.200
And then no, MySQL pod got created.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.407
So now we'll see PV,

01:23.407 --> 01:26.640
which is nothing but persistent volume got created

01:26.640 --> 01:28.020
and then it's in use.

01:28.020 --> 01:28.950
Okay? It's bound.

01:28.950 --> 01:32.310
Okay? So this is the persistent volume, it got created.

01:32.310 --> 01:37.310
So now let's go back and then see the pods.

01:38.010 --> 01:38.843
Right?

01:38.843 --> 01:41.550
So our MySQL pod is running.

01:41.550 --> 01:43.500
Okay? So that's about it.

01:43.500 --> 01:44.673
So if you want to,

01:45.960 --> 01:48.180
find it with the respective label,

01:48.180 --> 01:49.920
means like app is equal to MySQL

01:49.920 --> 01:52.080
so you can do like this, okay?

01:52.080 --> 01:55.530
Hyphen "l" app is equal to MySQL

01:55.530 --> 01:58.080
Even you can list using MySQL pods.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.160
That's all, okay?

01:59.160 --> 02:02.160
So how to use labels, this is a just simple command.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.920
So now we'll move on to connect to this MySQL

02:04.920 --> 02:06.030
and then see what happens.

02:06.030 --> 02:07.320
Okay?

02:07.320 --> 02:11.430
So let's use the command Kubectl run

02:11.430 --> 02:14.700
and then use the interactive terminal IT

02:14.700 --> 02:18.510
and then delete this pod whenever it has been exited.

02:18.510 --> 02:22.140
And then we are going to use image, right?

02:22.140 --> 02:25.980
MySQL 5.6 for our client also, restart never.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.210
And then MySQL client

02:27.210 --> 02:30.210
and then MySQL hyphen host is MySQL only.

02:30.210 --> 02:31.603
Why? Because whatever is running is

02:31.603 --> 02:32.860
a MySQL service only, right?

02:32.860 --> 02:37.380
And the password is DV password, 114 for our route password.

02:37.380 --> 02:40.050
Okay, so let's run this and then see what happens.

02:40.050 --> 02:41.220
Okay?

02:41.220 --> 02:43.620
So, right.

02:43.620 --> 02:46.470
So we should get the MySQL terminal, ideally.

02:46.470 --> 02:47.313
So let's see.

02:51.450 --> 02:53.700
It's taking a little bit of time.

02:53.700 --> 02:56.310
If you don't... Yeah, we got it, okay?

02:56.310 --> 02:58.650
So now if I say show schemas,

02:58.650 --> 02:59.910
so I should have,

02:59.910 --> 03:03.750
in addition to default schemas, user MGMT schema.

03:03.750 --> 03:04.920
So it got created.

03:04.920 --> 03:09.510
So whatever we have defined in our config map under data,

03:09.510 --> 03:13.710
the MySQL underscore user MGMT dot SQL got executed

03:13.710 --> 03:18.000
and it also created the user MGMT schema.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.280
So with this we have completed

03:20.280 --> 03:23.785
the creation of our entire section,

03:23.785 --> 03:26.760
which is creating a storage class,

03:26.760 --> 03:28.770
creating a persistent volume claim

03:28.770 --> 03:31.230
and then using the dynamic provisioning.

03:31.230 --> 03:33.150
And we have created the config map.

03:33.150 --> 03:36.540
And then we have also created the deployment for MySQL

03:36.540 --> 03:40.410
and also the cluster IP service for MySQL, okay?

03:40.410 --> 03:42.300
So if you want to see, we can even see.

03:42.300 --> 03:43.860
So I can exit from this.

03:43.860 --> 03:45.750
So I'll say quit.

03:45.750 --> 03:48.160
And my container, my pod got terminated.

03:48.160 --> 03:51.060
Okay, MySQL client pod got terminated.

03:51.060 --> 03:51.893
So good.

03:51.893 --> 03:54.660
So if I say Kubectl get pods

03:54.660 --> 03:57.030
and I should have only one pod now, yeah.

03:57.030 --> 04:00.960
And then I should see SVC which is our cluster IP service.

04:00.960 --> 04:01.793
So that's good.

04:01.793 --> 04:04.380
Okay, so now this is about entire stuff.

04:04.380 --> 04:05.220
In our next lecture,

04:05.220 --> 04:07.860
we'll discuss little bit about the references section.

04:07.860 --> 04:10.860
And then we'll close this entire 0402 section

04:10.860 --> 04:13.710
And then we'll move on to user management service.

04:13.710 --> 04:15.270
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

04:15.270 --> 04:16.893
Until then, bye bye. Thank you.
