00:00.180 --> 00:01.140
-: Welcome back.

00:01.140 --> 00:03.600
So in this lecture we are going to discuss

00:03.600 --> 00:06.420
about the references section exclusively, mainly related

00:06.420 --> 00:08.280
to EBS CSI driver.

00:08.280 --> 00:10.350
So I have provided all the links for you

00:10.350 --> 00:12.720
for your additional understanding and then more

00:12.720 --> 00:15.540
about the features available there and all those things.

00:15.540 --> 00:18.990
So this is the core link about our EBS CSI driver.

00:18.990 --> 00:22.380
So we can go in there and this is the dynamic provisioning

00:22.380 --> 00:25.950
whatever we have implemented and more examples

00:25.950 --> 00:28.080
are provided here for additional stuff here.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.100
So let's go here.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.680
Okay, so this is the EBS CSI driver.

00:31.680 --> 00:35.310
And if you see the current version it is running is V 0 5 0.

00:35.310 --> 00:37.710
And whenever you are testing it might be even 1.0

00:37.710 --> 00:38.910
or whatever, right?

00:38.910 --> 00:41.070
But whatever it may be the case.

00:41.070 --> 00:45.150
So the core thing here we need to understand is here, okay?

00:45.150 --> 00:47.760
So whatever the features it provides, static provisioning

00:47.760 --> 00:51.030
dynamic provisioning, mount option, NVME, block volume

00:51.030 --> 00:53.730
volume snapshot, and then volume resizing

00:53.730 --> 00:55.980
and important things when we are seeing the feature

00:55.980 --> 00:58.920
says all fasted, Okay?

00:58.920 --> 01:02.610
So volume resizing and volume snapshot are in alpha State

01:02.610 --> 01:06.030
and they are sometimes working, sometimes not working.

01:06.030 --> 01:08.130
They are in stable as on today.

01:08.130 --> 01:10.440
So that's the reason I didn't include these things.

01:10.440 --> 01:14.280
Okay, so block volume is in beta stage and the dynamic

01:14.280 --> 01:15.810
provisioning, these are also in beta

01:15.810 --> 01:18.570
stage, but the thing is they're ready for production.

01:18.570 --> 01:19.920
That's what AWS says.

01:19.920 --> 01:21.510
So we can use these things happily

01:21.510 --> 01:24.390
but the core thing is whatever you see, Alfa stages

01:24.390 --> 01:28.080
you crosscheck before you are using for your things means

01:28.080 --> 01:30.630
like when you want to use resizing, you need to

01:30.630 --> 01:35.630
say allow expansion through in our, in your storage class.

01:35.700 --> 01:36.900
Okay? I didn't define that here.

01:36.900 --> 01:37.920
Allow expansion through.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.410
You need to define an additional tag here, okay?

01:40.410 --> 01:42.090
So, but as it is in all frustrated

01:42.090 --> 01:45.660
it is not good to add that and then demonstrate it, okay?

01:45.660 --> 01:49.200
So it might change the why, because once it comes to beta

01:49.200 --> 01:52.230
the changes will be minimal, but if it is in alpha

01:52.230 --> 01:54.150
the tag might change or whatever it is.

01:54.150 --> 01:55.260
Okay?

01:55.260 --> 01:56.520
-: So that's about it.

01:56.520 --> 01:57.990
Don't worry about installation steps

01:57.990 --> 01:59.370
whatever here, here provided.

01:59.370 --> 02:02.400
So you need to allow, you follow the steps

02:02.400 --> 02:03.600
whatever I have provided here

02:03.600 --> 02:05.490
which is straight and then easy.

02:05.490 --> 02:08.010
And now next thing here is

02:08.010 --> 02:10.620
one more thing is this is the one examples

02:10.620 --> 02:12.150
for EBS CSI driver.

02:12.150 --> 02:14.160
So we have implemented dynamic provisioning

02:14.160 --> 02:16.200
with our Myer skill and we have

02:16.200 --> 02:18.510
for block volume and then for resizing.

02:18.510 --> 02:21.840
So if you see the resizing allow, I told you right?

02:21.840 --> 02:23.730
Allow volume expansion rules.

02:23.730 --> 02:25.530
So like this, you can provide all these things

02:25.530 --> 02:28.260
but you whatever you want to provide.

02:28.260 --> 02:29.640
and then based on your requirement

02:29.640 --> 02:31.500
what you want to use accordingly

02:31.500 --> 02:33.990
you can refer these examples means like you can go

02:33.990 --> 02:37.530
inside these examples and then go inside the spec

02:37.530 --> 02:40.410
and then find the example dot AML or whatever

02:40.410 --> 02:43.350
and then find the options related to your storage class

02:43.350 --> 02:46.440
and then persistent volume accordingly, and then leverage

02:46.440 --> 02:48.030
and then use it whenever you're doing

02:48.030 --> 02:49.830
in your real time environments based

02:49.830 --> 02:52.260
on the requirement, whatever you have.

02:52.260 --> 02:56.310
Okay? So that's about the references section here.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.530
Okay? So dynamic provision

02:58.530 --> 03:01.020
direct link I have provided and resizing snapshots

03:01.020 --> 03:03.120
everything you can see here, all the examples here.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.640
Okay? So in our next lecture we'll focus

03:05.640 --> 03:08.580
on creating the user management microservice

03:08.580 --> 03:09.413
which is connecting

03:09.413 --> 03:11.370
to the Myer scale database we have created.

03:11.370 --> 03:13.500
We'll create some users and then reference them

03:13.500 --> 03:16.800
in the database and list those users and everything.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.570
And then again, we'll clean up everything.

03:18.570 --> 03:19.620
So that's about it.

03:19.620 --> 03:21.090
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

03:21.090 --> 03:22.170
Until then, bye bye.

03:22.170 --> 03:23.003
Thank you.
