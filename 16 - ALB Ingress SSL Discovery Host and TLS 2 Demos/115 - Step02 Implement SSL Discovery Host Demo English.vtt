00:00.720 --> 00:01.650
-: Welcome back.

00:01.650 --> 00:03.930
Let's go to our GitHub repository

00:03.930 --> 00:08.730
and implement the demo one related to SSL discovery host.

00:08.730 --> 00:11.640
So we need to go here and we are

00:11.640 --> 00:15.810
in 08 new ELP application load balances

00:15.810 --> 00:20.810
and we are in 0810 right ingress SSL discovery host.

00:21.450 --> 00:24.960
And if you see here as part of step one

00:24.960 --> 00:28.380
we already understood about what we are going to implement.

00:28.380 --> 00:33.380
So we are going to go to this respective ingress manifest

00:33.570 --> 00:38.570
and just comment this certificate ARN related annotation.

00:41.970 --> 00:45.000
So this annotation will be commented

00:45.000 --> 00:49.320
and rest all is going to be as is from our previous section.

00:49.320 --> 00:52.320
And additionally we are also going to

00:52.320 --> 00:54.750
change the DNS names a little bit

00:54.750 --> 00:58.500
so that we don't face any Route 53 caching issues.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.920
So let's go back to our visual studio code here

01:01.920 --> 01:05.073
and go to the section 0810.

01:05.910 --> 01:07.890
And these cube manifests are a copy

01:07.890 --> 01:10.950
of the previous section which is 0809 name based

01:10.950 --> 01:12.390
at OSE routing.

01:12.390 --> 01:14.640
And as usual we have the app

01:14.640 --> 01:16.590
one app to app three deployment

01:16.590 --> 01:19.320
and note port services, no changes in them.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.840
So here you'll have something called

01:21.840 --> 01:24.690
the name of your ingress service is going to

01:24.690 --> 01:28.140
be ingress cert discovery Host demo.

01:28.140 --> 01:30.957
You can see here cert discovery host Ingres.

01:30.957 --> 01:35.550
And now if you come down here, so this certificate ARN

01:35.550 --> 01:39.090
related annotation is commented here.

01:39.090 --> 01:40.680
So earlier it used to be this way

01:40.680 --> 01:42.900
and now we have commented it

01:42.900 --> 01:45.120
and rest all is going to be as is.

01:45.120 --> 01:48.630
But only thing is earlier you have seen default 101.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.880
Now you'll see default 102.

01:50.880 --> 01:55.440
And here also you'll see app 102 and app 202.

01:55.440 --> 01:59.400
So this is to avoid any Route 53 related cache issues

01:59.400 --> 02:02.880
because that demo we implemented just now and deleted them

02:02.880 --> 02:04.230
right the previous demo.

02:04.230 --> 02:07.020
And now immediately we are implementing this demo.

02:07.020 --> 02:09.300
So if you use the same DNS names

02:09.300 --> 02:12.180
sometimes due to route 53 cache issues

02:12.180 --> 02:15.300
you'll not be able to access your application.

02:15.300 --> 02:18.480
So that's the reason we change the naming convention

02:18.480 --> 02:19.350
a little bit.

02:19.350 --> 02:23.610
But as part of this SSL discovery host option, right?

02:23.610 --> 02:27.180
So whatever the host present here it is using some some

02:27.180 --> 02:29.940
domain name.stack simplifi.com and some domain

02:29.940 --> 02:31.890
name.stack simplifi.com.

02:31.890 --> 02:36.150
So it need to automatically associate the star.stack

02:36.150 --> 02:39.900
simplifi.com SSL certificate from certificate manager

02:39.900 --> 02:43.200
to our application load balancer whenever we

02:43.200 --> 02:45.780
deploy this manifest, right?

02:45.780 --> 02:49.800
So this is 04 ALB ingress certificate discovery host.

02:49.800 --> 02:53.970
So let's come here and the next step here is right

02:53.970 --> 02:54.870
So the next step

02:54.870 --> 02:58.710
for us is to go ahead and then deploy these manifest and

02:58.710 --> 03:00.030
then test it.

03:00.030 --> 03:02.460
So we'll come out of 0809

03:02.460 --> 03:06.480
and we'll enter into 0810, right?

03:06.480 --> 03:10.410
So 10 which is ingress SSL discovery host

03:10.410 --> 03:15.410
and we'll say Cube CTL apply hyphen F cube manifest.

03:16.980 --> 03:18.030
And let's wait

03:18.030 --> 03:22.620
for the Kubernetes to deploy these applications

03:22.620 --> 03:25.050
which is app one, app to app three deployment

03:25.050 --> 03:28.260
and note port service and also ingress cert discovery

03:28.260 --> 03:30.720
host related ingress service.

03:30.720 --> 03:35.720
So as usual we can verify, get ports and app one, app two

03:36.262 --> 03:38.340
app three should be running

03:38.340 --> 03:41.850
and we we'll also see the SVC, which is services.

03:41.850 --> 03:44.910
Our three note port services should be created

03:44.910 --> 03:49.910
and we'll also verify the ingress service right

03:50.670 --> 03:54.840
and our ingress service also displayed here.

03:54.840 --> 03:58.350
The important thing for this demo is to verify

03:58.350 --> 04:02.730
you didn't mention any certificate ARN annotation

04:02.730 --> 04:07.590
in your ingress service related Kubernetes manifest.

04:07.590 --> 04:10.530
And what we need to do, so we just need to go

04:10.530 --> 04:14.250
to our easy to hear and go to load balancers

04:14.250 --> 04:18.120
in this cert discovery host English related load balancer.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.850
So we need to go to listeners and you need to

04:20.850 --> 04:23.490
verify the certificate associated with it.

04:23.490 --> 04:25.020
See this is the one right?

04:25.020 --> 04:28.831
For the 443 listener port, you are edit certificate.

04:28.831 --> 04:33.390
So you can see it has successfully associated the star.stack

04:33.390 --> 04:36.270
simplifi.com related certificate.

04:36.270 --> 04:39.220
So which if you want you can go to ACM and also

04:39.220 --> 04:41.550
crosscheck the certificate.

04:41.550 --> 04:45.390
So which clearly states that without mentioning the

04:45.390 --> 04:50.390
certificate ARN related annotation with the SSL discovery

04:50.610 --> 04:54.840
host option by default automatically it can where check

04:54.840 --> 04:57.840
for that certificate present in certificate manager

04:57.840 --> 05:02.700
and associate for our application load balancer

05:02.700 --> 05:06.000
automatically from our ingress service, right?

05:06.000 --> 05:08.610
So now let's come back here.

05:08.610 --> 05:11.970
So we have successfully verified this thing and

05:11.970 --> 05:14.070
if you want you can also verify the log.

05:14.070 --> 05:16.620
So again, the these steps are same as our name

05:16.620 --> 05:18.180
based virtual hosting.

05:18.180 --> 05:21.630
And if you want you can also access our application

05:21.630 --> 05:22.620
and then verify.

05:22.620 --> 05:26.010
So you can see here, so let's wait for all the logs to

05:26.010 --> 05:30.047
display and you can see app 102, app 202

05:30.047 --> 05:33.690
and default 102 DNS records also created.

05:33.690 --> 05:37.140
And if you want we can also do it and this lookup test

05:37.140 --> 05:39.030
and that looks good.

05:39.030 --> 05:42.870
So app 102, it looks good.

05:42.870 --> 05:47.340
And also app 202 and it also looks good.

05:47.340 --> 05:49.860
And if you want you can also access these things

05:49.860 --> 05:51.930
from browser, right?

05:51.930 --> 05:56.722
So I'll close the certificate manager here and you can see

05:56.722 --> 06:01.722
app 102 with app one is accessible and

06:01.800 --> 06:05.700
in the same way we can go here and app 202 should

06:05.700 --> 06:10.170
we should access the app two and it is accessible

06:10.170 --> 06:14.070
and we'll also access that default 102, right?

06:14.070 --> 06:16.320
So this should display that default application

06:16.320 --> 06:20.580
which is kubernetes fundamentals demo.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.200
Now let's come back

06:22.200 --> 06:26.280
and destroy these manifest or delete these manifest.

06:26.280 --> 06:30.990
So this completes the SSL discovery host related things.

06:30.990 --> 06:34.464
So without, without mentioning the certificate ARN

06:34.464 --> 06:38.160
so automatically ingress can automatically discover the

06:38.160 --> 06:40.380
SSL certificate and associated

06:40.380 --> 06:44.910
to the application load balancer using this host value.

06:44.910 --> 06:47.490
Whatever the DNS name associated here

06:47.490 --> 06:49.890
are the host name associated here.

06:49.890 --> 06:52.650
So in our next lecture we are going to learn

06:52.650 --> 06:55.860
about the SSL discovery TLS option.

06:55.860 --> 06:57.630
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

06:57.630 --> 06:58.950
Until then, bye bye.

06:58.950 --> 06:59.783
Thank you.
