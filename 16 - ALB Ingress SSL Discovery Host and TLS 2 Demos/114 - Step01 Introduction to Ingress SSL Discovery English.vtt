00:00.690 --> 00:01.530
-: Welcome back.

00:01.530 --> 00:03.180
In this section we are going

00:03.180 --> 00:06.510
to learn about the Kubernetes Ingress concept

00:06.510 --> 00:09.930
SSL discovery with host and TLS.

00:09.930 --> 00:12.720
So we are going to implement two demos

00:12.720 --> 00:14.820
as part of this concept.

00:14.820 --> 00:17.190
So now let's go and understand

00:17.190 --> 00:21.480
what exactly is this SSL certificate discovery, right?

00:21.480 --> 00:22.590
So if you see here,

00:22.590 --> 00:26.730
this is SSL certificate discovery using host.

00:26.730 --> 00:28.830
So if you see in the rules earlier,

00:28.830 --> 00:32.400
we have already implemented the host header base routing.

00:32.400 --> 00:36.420
So where you have seen the app 101.stacksimplify.com

00:36.420 --> 00:39.510
and app 201.stacksimplify.com,

00:39.510 --> 00:42.150
where specified in the Ingress rules

00:42.150 --> 00:44.640
with the host as the argument.

00:44.640 --> 00:48.780
So here, TLS certificates for ALB listeners

00:48.780 --> 00:52.650
can be automatically discovered with host names

00:52.650 --> 00:54.810
from Ingress resources.

00:54.810 --> 00:59.490
So if the ALB Ingress related certificate ARN

00:59.490 --> 01:01.350
is not specified.

01:01.350 --> 01:02.730
In simple terms,

01:02.730 --> 01:06.450
when you are using this host header base routing, right?

01:06.450 --> 01:08.458
So from these host values

01:08.458 --> 01:12.179
you have given that DNS name here very clearly,

01:12.179 --> 01:16.170
app101.stacksimplify.com.

01:16.170 --> 01:18.180
So which means you really don't need

01:18.180 --> 01:21.030
to provide this certificate ARN

01:21.030 --> 01:24.480
and related annotation and provide the ARN

01:24.480 --> 01:28.890
of your SSL certificate from your certificate manager.

01:28.890 --> 01:31.219
So by default, Ingress can directly

01:31.219 --> 01:35.310
take the available certificate for these names

01:35.310 --> 01:38.700
which means if the name matches stacksimplify.com.

01:38.700 --> 01:42.600
So if you have something called star.stacksimplify.com

01:42.600 --> 01:45.060
so that matches these domain names

01:45.060 --> 01:50.060
app101.stacksimplify.com and app201.stacksimplify.com

01:50.100 --> 01:51.990
So automatically it'll take that

01:51.990 --> 01:55.290
and then associate with your Ingress service.

01:55.290 --> 01:56.160
So which is nothing,

01:56.160 --> 02:00.450
but it'll associate with your application load balancer.

02:00.450 --> 02:02.280
We explicitly don't need

02:02.280 --> 02:05.820
to define this certificate ARN annotation.

02:05.820 --> 02:08.040
So which means which is a very good thing

02:08.040 --> 02:12.360
that we don't need to go to our certificate manager

02:12.360 --> 02:14.910
and go to that respective certificate

02:14.910 --> 02:19.910
and get the ARN and hard code that ARN in the service,

02:20.880 --> 02:23.040
we don't need to do all those tasks.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.480
So automatically it is going

02:24.480 --> 02:28.740
to take it with this SSL discovery with host option,

02:28.740 --> 02:31.470
whenever you are using the host base rules.

02:31.470 --> 02:33.570
In addition to that, any other rules,

02:33.570 --> 02:34.860
not the host base rules,

02:34.860 --> 02:37.410
you are doing the context part base routing, right?

02:37.410 --> 02:38.970
So at that point of time

02:38.970 --> 02:41.490
you are using only a default backend of something.

02:41.490 --> 02:43.020
So at that point of time,

02:43.020 --> 02:46.890
so it can also use something called a TLS field.

02:46.890 --> 02:47.820
So in the next demo

02:47.820 --> 02:50.610
we are going to see the TLS field related demo.

02:50.610 --> 02:54.000
So the controller will attempt to discover TLS certificates

02:54.000 --> 02:56.070
from the TLS field in the Ingress

02:56.070 --> 02:58.410
and host field in the Ingress rules.

02:58.410 --> 03:01.230
So this part you have seen host field in the Ingress rules,

03:01.230 --> 03:02.730
you already seen here.

03:02.730 --> 03:04.560
And in the next demo we are going to,

03:04.560 --> 03:07.950
in the next slide we are going to see that TLS field related

03:07.950 --> 03:08.783
thing too.

03:08.783 --> 03:10.410
And another important note here

03:10.410 --> 03:12.930
is you need to explicitly specify

03:12.930 --> 03:17.010
to use HTTPS listener with listen ports annotation.

03:17.010 --> 03:18.990
And anyway we are going to do that

03:18.990 --> 03:22.560
and we have already seen in our Ingress resources also.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.390
So you can see we are already specifying

03:24.390 --> 03:27.960
the listen ports 443 for our SSL communication.

03:27.960 --> 03:31.170
So we have no issues with this important node.

03:31.170 --> 03:33.360
So now let's come back to this demo two,

03:33.360 --> 03:36.120
which is SSL discovery with TLS.

03:36.120 --> 03:39.270
So here if you see your DNS name you have provided us

03:39.270 --> 03:43.050
start to discover a TLS 901.stacksimplify.com.

03:43.050 --> 03:45.540
You have something called your default backend.

03:45.540 --> 03:48.270
And here there is no host rules here.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.872
This is simple context port-based routing

03:50.872 --> 03:52.570
related example, right?

03:52.570 --> 03:56.340
So at that point when you are using other than host.

03:56.340 --> 03:57.900
And then if you want to use,

03:57.900 --> 04:00.990
if you want to auto detect your SSL certificate

04:00.990 --> 04:03.330
and associate with your Ingress service,

04:03.330 --> 04:05.370
which means it need to associate

04:05.370 --> 04:07.350
with your application load balancer,

04:07.350 --> 04:10.252
you can also use this TLS option

04:10.252 --> 04:14.040
and provide with TLS hosts and provide your host names here,

04:14.040 --> 04:16.170
star.stacksimplify.com.

04:16.170 --> 04:18.870
So automatically this related certificate

04:18.870 --> 04:23.172
will be associated with your Ingress resourcer service,

04:23.172 --> 04:25.513
which means whenever we are implementing

04:25.513 --> 04:28.680
these SSL certificate discovery in Ingress

04:28.680 --> 04:31.200
using host or TLS options,

04:31.200 --> 04:35.160
we really don't need to have this annotation enabled.

04:35.160 --> 04:38.970
So you can go ahead and then commend this certificate here

04:38.970 --> 04:42.600
and related annotation in your both demos.

04:42.600 --> 04:45.330
So this completes the introductory part

04:45.330 --> 04:49.590
of SSL discovery using host and TLS in Ingress.

04:49.590 --> 04:50.516
In our next demo,

04:50.516 --> 04:53.755
in our next lecture

04:53.755 --> 04:54.810
we are going to practically go ahead

04:54.810 --> 04:56.610
and then implement these things.

04:56.610 --> 04:58.710
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

04:58.710 --> 04:59.940
Until then, bye bye.

04:59.940 --> 05:00.773
Thank you.
