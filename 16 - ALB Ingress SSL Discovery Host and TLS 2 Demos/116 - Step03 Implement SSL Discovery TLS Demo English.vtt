00:00.570 --> 00:01.403
-: Welcome back.

00:01.403 --> 00:04.200
In this demo we are going to implement SSL

00:04.200 --> 00:07.680
discovery, TLs option in Ingress surveys.

00:07.680 --> 00:11.160
So now let's go back to our GitHub repository,

00:11.160 --> 00:16.110
and we are in zero eight new ERP application load balances,

00:16.110 --> 00:20.160
and we are entering into the section 0811

00:20.160 --> 00:23.790
Ingress SSL discovery TLS, right?

00:23.790 --> 00:25.710
So as part of introductory section,

00:25.710 --> 00:27.780
we already know what is host

00:27.780 --> 00:32.780
and TLS from SSL discovery concept perspective in Ingress.

00:33.060 --> 00:34.590
So now we are going to go ahead

00:34.590 --> 00:38.070
and then review this Ingress manifest.

00:38.070 --> 00:41.070
So let's go back to our visual studio core,

00:41.070 --> 00:46.070
and enter into the section 0811 Kube manifest

00:46.380 --> 00:51.380
and 010203 app one app two app three deployment node ports,

00:51.930 --> 00:54.060
and node port services are going to be

00:54.060 --> 00:56.520
as is from our previous section,

00:56.520 --> 01:00.630
and if you come back here right, zero four,

01:00.630 --> 01:04.500
the name of this respective Ingress service is going to

01:04.500 --> 01:07.890
be Ingress cert discovery TLS demo.

01:07.890 --> 01:10.020
And here also the load balancer name is

01:10.020 --> 01:12.870
cert discovery TLS Ingress,

01:12.870 --> 01:16.050
and here as usual as part of previous demo

01:16.050 --> 01:19.740
also we have commented the certificate error

01:19.740 --> 01:23.610
because we are testing the SSL discovery concept here.

01:23.610 --> 01:26.896
So we need to comment this and if you come back here

01:26.896 --> 01:30.120
the external DNS related host name is going

01:30.120 --> 01:32.965
to be the DNS name is going to be cert discovery

01:32.965 --> 01:36.960
TLS101.stacksimplify.com.

01:36.960 --> 01:40.110
And the rules we are using the context part

01:40.110 --> 01:41.130
based rules here.

01:41.130 --> 01:43.800
So when the request comes with slash app one go

01:43.800 --> 01:47.490
to app one nginx node port service, and when it comes

01:47.490 --> 01:51.120
to slash app to go to app two nginx node port service,

01:51.120 --> 01:54.990
and default backend is app three nginx node port service.

01:54.990 --> 01:57.390
So all these things we are going to access using

01:57.390 --> 01:59.340
that DNS host name cert discovery

01:59.340 --> 02:02.820
TLS101.stacksimplify.com.

02:02.820 --> 02:06.180
But as you have not specified the certificate

02:06.180 --> 02:08.910
here and here, so automatically how we need

02:08.910 --> 02:12.780
to associate the SSL certificate is using this option.

02:12.780 --> 02:15.480
So TLS and host sees a list item,

02:15.480 --> 02:18.570
and you can define multiple things here if you want, right?

02:18.570 --> 02:22.440
So, but here we have the star.stacksimplify.com

02:22.440 --> 02:25.050
is associated here now.

02:25.050 --> 02:28.650
So automatically our stacksimplify.com related

02:28.650 --> 02:31.980
SSL certificate which is wildcard certificate,

02:31.980 --> 02:34.620
we have created is going to be associated

02:34.620 --> 02:36.360
to this Ingress service.

02:36.360 --> 02:37.740
So let's go back here

02:37.740 --> 02:40.533
and deploy these manifest and then test it.

02:41.520 --> 02:46.520
So let's go to 0811 Ingress SSL discovery TLS,

02:48.159 --> 02:53.159
and say Kube CTL apply hyphen F Kube manifest.

02:53.580 --> 02:57.480
So this should create the app on app to app three node port

02:57.480 --> 03:01.170
and deployments for those applications, and also

03:01.170 --> 03:05.640
create a Ingress sub discovery TLS demo Ingress service.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.770
So I'll run the command Kube CTL,

03:07.770 --> 03:12.240
get ports and services just to check

03:12.240 --> 03:17.240
those were created or not and also SVC.

03:17.310 --> 03:20.040
And you can see app one app to app three nginx port are

03:20.040 --> 03:23.430
running and also equal and node port services created,

03:23.430 --> 03:28.170
and I'll say Kube CTL get Ingress to verify

03:28.170 --> 03:30.690
our Ingress service got created.

03:30.690 --> 03:33.060
And you can see cert discovery tier list.

03:33.060 --> 03:37.470
This is the address of our Ingress service,

03:37.470 --> 03:41.160
and it is also listing on ports 80 and then 443,

03:41.160 --> 03:45.630
and it belongs to the Ingress class, my AWS Ingress class.

03:45.630 --> 03:49.320
So now let's come back here and verify

03:49.320 --> 03:51.180
the same thing with certificate.

03:51.180 --> 03:55.140
So let's come back and cert discover TLS Ingress,

03:55.140 --> 03:59.628
and we need to go to our HTTPS 443 listener and verify

03:59.628 --> 04:03.090
if our certificate is associated successfully

04:03.090 --> 04:07.410
star.stacksimplify.com is associated successfully

04:07.410 --> 04:09.750
to our application load balancer.

04:09.750 --> 04:13.170
So which means the demo whatever we are implementing SSL

04:13.170 --> 04:16.830
discovery using TLS option in Ingress service should

04:16.830 --> 04:21.210
associate the SSL certificate from the certificate manager

04:21.210 --> 04:22.559
whatever we have created

04:22.559 --> 04:25.230
to the application load balancer, right?

04:25.230 --> 04:27.990
And it is successfully associated.

04:27.990 --> 04:32.550
So let me close these things, right and let's come back here

04:32.550 --> 04:37.020
and if you want we can also do a, and let's look up test

04:37.020 --> 04:41.520
for our third discovery TLS, 101 related DNS.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.403
And what is the DNS we have used here?

04:45.510 --> 04:46.343
101.

04:46.343 --> 04:47.910
So this is the one, right?

04:47.910 --> 04:51.333
So sometimes this is a problem with the thing.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.980
And let's look up, and you can see,

04:55.980 --> 05:00.063
can't find cert discovery TLS, no answer, why?

05:01.230 --> 05:05.250
Maybe let's verify that logs here,

05:05.250 --> 05:08.190
and also verify the Route 53 here, right?

05:08.190 --> 05:13.083
So let's go out and go to the hosted zone stacksimplify.com,

05:14.040 --> 05:16.953
and you can see third discovery is created.

05:23.280 --> 05:28.280
So this is the problem usually, sometimes we face this.

05:28.740 --> 05:32.463
So that's the reason I usually give different names.

05:33.990 --> 05:38.990
So I'll put 102 and Kube CTL, apply hyphen F Kube manifests,

05:43.320 --> 05:45.303
and let's see what happens.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.140
And we'll go here.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.640
We have changed the DNS name

05:59.640 --> 06:04.320
from 1012102, maybe some Route 53 caching issues.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.240
So I'll try to do DNS lookup now.

06:06.240 --> 06:10.560
So 101 is deleted and automatically 102 is created.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.930
So now let's copy this

06:12.930 --> 06:16.203
and do DNS lookup and then see what happens, right?

06:17.250 --> 06:20.040
And this is resolving, so this is what is the thing,

06:20.040 --> 06:23.610
usually I always put the different name whenever

06:23.610 --> 06:26.760
I am testing it for the demos, right?

06:26.760 --> 06:31.410
So now let's come back here and access it in the browser.

06:31.410 --> 06:36.410
Cert discovery TLS102.stacksimplify.com/app1.index.html.

06:38.280 --> 06:42.090
So it should automatically redirect to https, right?

06:42.090 --> 06:44.730
So the lock symbol you can see, right?

06:44.730 --> 06:47.130
And if you go here and see the certificate,

06:47.130 --> 06:51.720
so star.stacksimplify.com certificate is associated here.

06:51.720 --> 06:55.290
And we will also check the app two, right, app two

06:55.290 --> 06:59.610
slash index dot html, and we'll also verify

06:59.610 --> 07:02.940
the root contact, see, lock is present here,

07:02.940 --> 07:04.540
automatically redirected to SSL,

07:05.850 --> 07:07.913
and we'll also verify the root context.

07:07.913 --> 07:10.080
And app three is also successful.

07:10.080 --> 07:13.380
So app one, app two, and our app three,

07:13.380 --> 07:15.780
all three are successful,

07:15.780 --> 07:19.440
and we'll go ahead and then clean up these things.

07:19.440 --> 07:24.000
So Kube CTL, delete hyphen F, and Kube manifest.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.400
So this should clean up all the things

07:26.400 --> 07:28.740
whatever we have created.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.980
So now let's go back here and verify

07:31.980 --> 07:35.790
if our Ingress service is deleted, and it is deleted.

07:35.790 --> 07:37.680
Now let's go to route 53,

07:37.680 --> 07:40.200
and verify if our hosted zone related

07:40.200 --> 07:45.090
to cert discovery TLS 102 is deleted,

07:45.090 --> 07:46.500
and it's still waiting.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.960
So let's wait for it to delete,

07:48.960 --> 07:52.950
or we can also go back here and verify the logs.

07:52.950 --> 07:56.970
So let's come up here and go to terminal

07:56.970 --> 08:00.840
and verify the cert discovery related external DNS.

08:00.840 --> 08:04.680
We can see here cert discovery TLS 102 is deleted.

08:04.680 --> 08:05.760
So we can go here,

08:05.760 --> 08:09.570
and then crosscheck the same thing in route 53.

08:09.570 --> 08:11.190
So go to hosted zones,

08:11.190 --> 08:14.400
and go to stacksimplify.com and go down,

08:14.400 --> 08:19.400
and you'll not find any cert discovery TLS 102 related DNS.

08:19.470 --> 08:24.470
So this completes the SSL cert discovery related, both demos

08:24.840 --> 08:27.390
which is host and then TLS.

08:27.390 --> 08:30.660
So in our next section, we are going to understand

08:30.660 --> 08:32.880
about one more Ingress concept.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.470
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

08:34.470 --> 08:35.730
Until then, bye bye.

08:35.730 --> 08:36.563
Thank you.
