00:00.360 --> 00:01.380
-: Welcome back.

00:01.380 --> 00:04.353
In this demo, we are going to create a network load balancer

00:04.353 --> 00:06.480
with Kubernetes service

00:06.480 --> 00:09.300
and ensure that that network load balancer

00:09.300 --> 00:12.630
uses elastic IPs, right?

00:12.630 --> 00:15.360
So, first we will create the elastic IPs

00:15.360 --> 00:19.350
and take those elastic IP EIP allocation IDs

00:19.350 --> 00:21.690
and associate them or update them

00:21.690 --> 00:24.690
in our elastic IP related annotation

00:24.690 --> 00:28.680
in our Kubernetes load balancer service manifest.

00:28.680 --> 00:32.910
So, from network design perspective, there are no changes.

00:32.910 --> 00:36.750
Only thing is, we are going to add additional elastic IPs

00:36.750 --> 00:38.730
here in the public subnets.

00:38.730 --> 00:41.280
One important thing here is,

00:41.280 --> 00:44.667
whenever we add this elastic IP related annotation

00:44.667 --> 00:47.910
AWS load balancer EIP allocations,

00:47.910 --> 00:51.030
so we need to ensure that these elastic IPs

00:51.030 --> 00:53.580
are directly proportional to the number of subnets

00:53.580 --> 00:56.490
where your network load balancer is getting created.

00:56.490 --> 00:59.160
So which means, we are creating in the public subnets

00:59.160 --> 01:01.440
our respect to network load balancer.

01:01.440 --> 01:04.920
So our EIP allocations or our elastic IPs should be

01:04.920 --> 01:07.260
equal to the number of subnets

01:07.260 --> 01:11.190
if we are not specifying any subnets annotation.

01:11.190 --> 01:13.920
If we specify the subnets annotation

01:13.920 --> 01:17.370
and where you specify number of subnets there,

01:17.370 --> 01:19.890
so those number of subnets is directly proportional

01:19.890 --> 01:22.080
to elastic IPs you should create.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.000
So, that is one important note.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.060
And second one is your NLB must be

01:27.060 --> 01:28.800
in the internet facing edge

01:28.800 --> 01:32.317
for these elastic IPs to be associated for your NLB.

01:33.330 --> 01:38.330
So now, network load balancers not only deals with the TCP,

01:38.520 --> 01:42.810
but also it deals with UDP and also TLS connections.

01:42.810 --> 01:45.720
So, for some applications which are using UDP,

01:45.720 --> 01:48.960
so, instead of DNS if they expect to

01:48.960 --> 01:52.530
connect to your NLB using IP address, right?

01:52.530 --> 01:56.190
So at that point of time, giving a static elastic IP

01:56.190 --> 01:59.940
which never changes is a reasonable option.

01:59.940 --> 02:01.710
So at that point of time,

02:01.710 --> 02:06.510
so this elastic IP association to our network load balancer

02:06.510 --> 02:08.610
will be a big advantage.

02:08.610 --> 02:12.690
So for that purpose, we'll also see this demo practically.

02:12.690 --> 02:15.120
So let's go back to our GitHub repo

02:15.120 --> 02:19.440
in 19 ELB network load balances with LBC.

02:19.440 --> 02:24.440
So, we are in 1904 LBC and NLB elastic IP.

02:25.110 --> 02:26.550
So as part of step two,

02:26.550 --> 02:29.190
step one is introduction, which we have seen.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.390
So we are going to go ahead

02:30.390 --> 02:33.600
and then create two elastic IPs for us.

02:33.600 --> 02:37.530
So in the EC2 section in the AWS management console,

02:37.530 --> 02:41.820
in network and security, we can see the elastic IPs here.

02:41.820 --> 02:44.370
So we have one elastic IP already created

02:44.370 --> 02:47.760
as part of EKS cluster control plane creation.

02:47.760 --> 02:51.250
So wherein this elastic IP is used to

02:53.690 --> 02:58.050
for the EKS worker notes present in the private subnet

02:58.050 --> 03:02.250
to communicate to your EKS cluster control plane outbound.

03:02.250 --> 03:05.490
So now, we'll create two elastic IPs.

03:05.490 --> 03:07.830
So, US east 1 is the region

03:07.830 --> 03:12.480
and we'll say allocate, right?

03:12.480 --> 03:14.040
And we'll create one more.

03:14.040 --> 03:19.040
So I can also say this as IP 1.

03:19.996 --> 03:21.400
Or I can say EIP,

03:22.921 --> 03:23.754
EIP 1

03:25.380 --> 03:28.020
And I'll create one more elastic IP address

03:28.020 --> 03:33.000
and I'll say allocate in US east 1 region and allocate.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.680
And I'll say it as EIP 2.

03:37.680 --> 03:38.513
Save.

03:39.480 --> 03:42.210
So, now you can see we have created two IPs,

03:42.210 --> 03:44.190
EIP 1 and EIP 2.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.710
So now, let's go to the next step

03:46.710 --> 03:49.440
which is review elastic IPS annotations.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.080
So we'll go here, right?

03:52.080 --> 03:56.280
In 1904 LBC NLB elastic IP

03:56.280 --> 03:59.940
in 02 and LBC NLB load balancer service.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.430
So for this EIP allocation ideas,

04:02.430 --> 04:04.290
I'll remove these two things, right?

04:04.290 --> 04:06.821
For this respect to annotation

04:06.821 --> 04:09.990
AWS load balancer EIP allocations.

04:09.990 --> 04:13.440
So I'll come here and come here, right?

04:13.440 --> 04:15.743
And this is the EIP 1 and that is the EIP 2.

04:15.743 --> 04:19.980
So I'll go here and take these allocation IDs.

04:19.980 --> 04:24.240
So this is the first one and I'll put it here comma.

04:24.240 --> 04:26.820
And this is the second one.

04:26.820 --> 04:30.240
So, I have updated both allocation,

04:30.240 --> 04:32.010
EIP allocation IDs

04:32.010 --> 04:36.900
to our EIP allocation annotation in my Kubernetes service.

04:36.900 --> 04:40.650
And name also you can see elastic IP LBC network LB.

04:40.650 --> 04:41.940
And here also it is same.

04:41.940 --> 04:45.630
Rest all is going to be as is from the previous demo

04:45.630 --> 04:48.720
and nginx app three deployment also no changes.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.670
So let's go to the terminal

04:50.670 --> 04:54.990
and in section 19, we'll go inside 1904, right?

04:54.990 --> 04:57.480
LBC NLB elastic IP

04:57.480 --> 04:59.825
and we'll say cube CTL apply

04:59.825 --> 05:02.610
hyphen F and cube manifests.

05:02.610 --> 05:06.600
So, this should create the app three nginx deployment

05:06.600 --> 05:11.600
and also create the elastic IP related Kubernetes service.

05:12.060 --> 05:15.810
So, we'll say cube CTL get as pods.

05:15.810 --> 05:17.643
App 3 nginx should be running.

05:18.510 --> 05:19.860
This is good.

05:19.860 --> 05:21.900
And we'll also run the SVC.

05:21.900 --> 05:24.570
So, this should provide the service

05:24.570 --> 05:28.740
which is elastic IP LBC network LB, right?

05:28.740 --> 05:32.310
And you can see port 80 and 443 listeners created.

05:32.310 --> 05:35.400
And now, the important thing here is,

05:35.400 --> 05:37.410
so this one, right?

05:37.410 --> 05:39.450
Should have the elastic IP addresses.

05:39.450 --> 05:43.110
So let's come back here right to your load balancer

05:43.110 --> 05:46.860
or you can, from here itself get SVC, right?

05:46.860 --> 05:49.200
And take this DNS name, right?

05:49.200 --> 05:52.950
Copy and say NS lookup.

05:52.950 --> 05:57.170
And this elastic IP related load balancer

05:57.170 --> 05:59.100
whatever you have created,

05:59.100 --> 06:02.010
so once it completes the creation,

06:02.010 --> 06:03.570
so we can see the NS lookup

06:03.570 --> 06:05.730
and the DNS name, whatever here,

06:05.730 --> 06:08.910
this resolves to the elastic IPs

06:08.910 --> 06:11.460
to whatever you have created.

06:11.460 --> 06:12.660
So let's wait for it.

06:12.660 --> 06:16.830
So, it should resolve to these two IP addresses.

06:16.830 --> 06:20.940
We can see here this load balancer is in active state now.

06:20.940 --> 06:24.693
So, let's do the NS lookup and the DNS name.

06:25.740 --> 06:29.100
And you can see it is resolving to two IP addresses.

06:29.100 --> 06:32.160
100, 24, 223, 234.

06:32.160 --> 06:36.150
And this one also 34, 238, 77, 28.

06:36.150 --> 06:38.730
So this should match the elastic IPs,

06:38.730 --> 06:41.460
which is 100, 24, 223, 234

06:41.460 --> 06:46.460
and also this is with the 34 238, 77, 28.

06:46.590 --> 06:47.610
So, this is good.

06:47.610 --> 06:51.990
In addition to that, if you also verify this one, right?

06:51.990 --> 06:56.790
So you are custom DNS, NLB EIP 201.

06:56.790 --> 06:59.940
So if you do the NS look up for this one also,

06:59.940 --> 07:01.680
it should result to the same IP address,

07:01.680 --> 07:05.070
100, 24, 223, 234.

07:05.070 --> 07:10.070
Why? Because this DNS is an alias to this DNS only, right?

07:10.260 --> 07:12.510
So, now let's come back here

07:12.510 --> 07:14.850
and also access it in the browser.

07:14.850 --> 07:18.600
And your application should be accessible with http

07:18.600 --> 07:21.060
and also https.

07:21.060 --> 07:24.990
So this completes the elastic IPs demo.

07:24.990 --> 07:28.320
So let's go ahead and then clean up the stuff here.

07:28.320 --> 07:32.790
So the first thing is clear and cube CTL,

07:32.790 --> 07:35.820
delete, hyphen F and cube manifests.

07:35.820 --> 07:37.560
So once these are deleted,

07:37.560 --> 07:42.300
we'll go here and also delete the elastic IPs, right?

07:42.300 --> 07:43.470
So, let's wait for it.

07:43.470 --> 07:45.150
So these are deleted.

07:45.150 --> 07:50.150
So now let's say, refresh, right?

07:51.570 --> 07:54.120
And select this one.

07:54.120 --> 07:57.030
And disassociate elastic IP,

07:57.030 --> 07:59.520
it's already disassociated I think.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.050
So let's wait for some time

08:01.050 --> 08:04.443
for these things to be released and shown as released state.

08:05.737 --> 08:09.340
I see here, or I will refresh this

08:11.340 --> 08:12.213
Select.

08:14.580 --> 08:16.110
So it'll take a little while

08:16.110 --> 08:18.210
after network load balancer is deleted.

08:18.210 --> 08:23.210
So now you can see EIP and release this elastic IP, right?

08:24.810 --> 08:29.013
And this one also release elastic IP.

08:30.150 --> 08:32.310
This should be good now.

08:32.310 --> 08:34.170
Now, let's come back here

08:34.170 --> 08:37.480
and also ensure that we verify

08:40.029 --> 08:44.910
our network load balancer is deleted successfully.

08:44.910 --> 08:46.470
So that is very important thing.

08:46.470 --> 08:49.410
Because if by any chance it is present,

08:49.410 --> 08:51.720
it is going to cost lot of money for us

08:51.720 --> 08:55.170
if we leave it idol without knowing.

08:55.170 --> 08:58.500
So, this completes the elastic IP demo.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.490
In our next demo,

08:59.490 --> 09:02.640
we are going to focus on NLB with internal,

09:02.640 --> 09:06.360
means like creating a internal network load balancer.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.920
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.240
Until, then, bye-bye.

09:09.240 --> 09:10.073
Thank you.
