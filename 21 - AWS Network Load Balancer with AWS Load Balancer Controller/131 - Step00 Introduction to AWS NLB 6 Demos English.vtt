00:00.450 --> 00:01.440
-: Welcome back.

00:01.440 --> 00:02.730
As part of this section,

00:02.730 --> 00:06.060
we are going to create AWS network load balancers

00:06.060 --> 00:07.860
using Kubernetes service

00:07.860 --> 00:10.140
on EKS cluster.

00:10.140 --> 00:13.020
So earlier, as part of Ingress,

00:13.020 --> 00:15.690
when we are learning with application load balancer

00:15.690 --> 00:16.740
ALB Ingress,

00:16.740 --> 00:21.060
we already installed the AWS load balancer controller.

00:21.060 --> 00:23.130
The same load balancer controller

00:23.130 --> 00:27.750
will be able to also create the AWS network load balancer

00:27.750 --> 00:32.010
whenever we use the Kubernetes object of type service.

00:32.010 --> 00:36.300
So using that, we are going to create six demos

00:36.300 --> 00:40.140
and understand AWS network load balancer

00:40.140 --> 00:42.900
using Kubernetes service, which means

00:42.900 --> 00:45.810
we are going to declaratively write the configuration

00:45.810 --> 00:49.050
in Kubernetes k8s yaml manifest

00:49.050 --> 00:53.610
and create the AWS network load balancer-related use cases.

00:53.610 --> 00:57.030
So to start with, we are going to do, in the Demo 1,

00:57.030 --> 01:00.690
we are going to understand and implement NLB basics,

01:00.690 --> 01:03.210
which means all the important annotations

01:03.210 --> 01:06.360
related to NLB basics, we are going to write it

01:06.360 --> 01:10.380
and understand them from the Kubernetes service perspective.

01:10.380 --> 01:13.050
And then we'll move on to the next demo,

01:13.050 --> 01:16.110
which is NLB TLS SSL,

01:16.110 --> 01:19.830
which means we are going to implement SSL

01:19.830 --> 01:24.180
for our network load balancer from Kubernetes service.

01:24.180 --> 01:25.860
From there, we'll move on

01:25.860 --> 01:28.230
and also implement the NLB

01:28.230 --> 01:30.180
and then external DNS.

01:30.180 --> 01:33.390
So, how we have implemented the external DNS use case

01:33.390 --> 01:35.190
in application load balancer?

01:35.190 --> 01:38.670
Same way, we will also update the annotations

01:38.670 --> 01:42.150
related to external DNS in Kubernetes service

01:42.150 --> 01:46.260
and ensure that NLB DNS also successfully registers

01:46.260 --> 01:49.980
using external DNS in Route 53.

01:49.980 --> 01:52.740
And we'll also implement NLB

01:52.740 --> 01:56.070
and then elastic IP as Demo 4.

01:56.070 --> 01:57.810
And as part of Demo 5,

01:57.810 --> 02:01.980
we'll also implement internal network load balancer.

02:01.980 --> 02:06.090
And we are also going to test that with the curl pod.

02:06.090 --> 02:08.340
And as part of Demo 6,

02:08.340 --> 02:11.430
we'll also implement network load balancer

02:11.430 --> 02:13.320
sending the traffic to the ports

02:13.320 --> 02:15.960
running on the Fargate infrastructure,

02:15.960 --> 02:19.560
which is a serverless infrastructure from AWS perspective.

02:19.560 --> 02:23.250
So all these demos we are going to implement step by step.

02:23.250 --> 02:24.840
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.553
Until then, bye-bye. Thank you.
