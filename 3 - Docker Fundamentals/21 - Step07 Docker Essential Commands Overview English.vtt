00:00.540 --> 00:01.373
-: Welcome back.

00:01.373 --> 00:03.540
So in the previous lecture, we have ensured

00:03.540 --> 00:05.730
that we have created a new Docker image,

00:05.730 --> 00:07.260
we have built the new Docker image

00:07.260 --> 00:08.790
and then pushed it to the Docker Hub,

00:08.790 --> 00:10.380
and then verified it.

00:10.380 --> 00:13.860
So now we are going to see few essential Docker commands.

00:13.860 --> 00:16.470
So most of them already we have used,

00:16.470 --> 00:18.450
and then we have implemented so far

00:18.450 --> 00:22.920
in our last few lectures, but we can again one more time,

00:22.920 --> 00:24.390
have a look into it, okay?

00:24.390 --> 00:26.730
So, docker ps, which is nothing but,

00:26.730 --> 00:29.010
list all running containers,

00:29.010 --> 00:31.800
docker ps -a, list all containers,

00:31.800 --> 00:34.260
stopped and then running, so both.

00:34.260 --> 00:37.110
So and then, docker stop and then container ID,

00:37.110 --> 00:38.790
stop the container which is running.

00:38.790 --> 00:40.740
So either it is a container ID,

00:40.740 --> 00:42.750
or you can give the container name also,

00:42.750 --> 00:44.640
if your container is named

00:44.640 --> 00:46.860
with hyphen hyphen name when you are running it.

00:46.860 --> 00:49.770
Docker run and then hyphen hyphen name if you have given.

00:49.770 --> 00:52.410
So then when you're stopping it or starting it,

00:52.410 --> 00:54.660
instead of finding the container ID and giving it,

00:54.660 --> 00:56.820
you know the name, then you can directly give the name,

00:56.820 --> 00:58.740
even for start and then restart also,

00:58.740 --> 01:00.060
you can use those.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.760
So docker port container ID will provide you

01:02.760 --> 01:06.210
the list of port mappings of a specific container.

01:06.210 --> 01:09.240
And for removing the container, either container ID

01:09.240 --> 01:11.160
or name you can provide.

01:11.160 --> 01:14.220
And docker remove the running containers forcefully,

01:14.220 --> 01:18.690
you can use -f as the one of the argument.

01:18.690 --> 01:20.970
So, and if you want to see the image info,

01:20.970 --> 01:23.340
pull the image from Docker Hub repository.

01:23.340 --> 01:25.530
So docker pull and then image info.

01:25.530 --> 01:28.710
Image info is nothing but the complete image name.

01:28.710 --> 01:31.560
And pull the image from Docker Hub repository,

01:31.560 --> 01:32.940
this is an additional example

01:32.940 --> 01:34.710
for whatever we are seeing here.

01:34.710 --> 01:36.210
This is the example.

01:36.210 --> 01:39.300
So, in addition you are seeing the docker exec -it

01:39.300 --> 01:42.000
and the container name, and then /bin/sh

01:42.000 --> 01:44.430
to connect to the Linux container

01:44.430 --> 01:47.460
and execute commands on that respective container.

01:47.460 --> 01:49.020
So, which means connect to the container

01:49.020 --> 01:51.000
and then execute commands or verify something,

01:51.000 --> 01:52.440
you can do this one.

01:52.440 --> 01:55.410
And to remove the image, docker rmi,

01:55.410 --> 01:59.820
and to log out from our Docker Hub account, docker logout.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.950
To log in, docker login.

02:01.950 --> 02:04.500
And then to display a live stats of our container,

02:04.500 --> 02:06.180
docker stats.

02:06.180 --> 02:08.970
So to display the running processes of a container,

02:08.970 --> 02:11.070
docker top.

02:11.070 --> 02:14.160
And finally, you see here the docker version.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.140
So there will be lot of sub-commands

02:16.140 --> 02:18.330
under docker run and all those things,

02:18.330 --> 02:21.360
but on a very high level, to manage Docker,

02:21.360 --> 02:24.540
these are the core commands which we should be aware of.

02:24.540 --> 02:26.283
And more commands we'll be adding,

02:27.150 --> 02:29.940
when we are getting more, gaining experience

02:29.940 --> 02:33.510
on the Docker, by implementing multiple use cases.

02:33.510 --> 02:35.520
But, from fundamentals perspective,

02:35.520 --> 02:38.190
how to stop containers, start container, what is an image,

02:38.190 --> 02:40.710
how to download the image, how to run the image,

02:40.710 --> 02:42.300
and how to remove the image,

02:42.300 --> 02:43.680
and how to remove the container,

02:43.680 --> 02:46.590
or how to connect to the container terminal,

02:46.590 --> 02:48.180
all these things are required,

02:48.180 --> 02:50.370
and all these things are listed here.

02:50.370 --> 02:53.940
So this completes the essential commands overview

02:53.940 --> 02:54.990
for Docker.

02:54.990 --> 02:56.730
So, I'll see you in the next lecture.

02:56.730 --> 02:58.623
Until then, bye bye, thank you.
