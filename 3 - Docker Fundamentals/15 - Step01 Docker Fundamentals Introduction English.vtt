00:00.720 --> 00:02.130
-: Welcome back.

00:02.130 --> 00:05.220
In this section we are going to primarily focus on

00:05.220 --> 00:07.350
Docker Fundamentals.

00:07.350 --> 00:09.630
So, what are the topics involved

00:09.630 --> 00:11.700
in understanding the Docker Fundamentals?

00:11.700 --> 00:14.850
Let's go ahead and then see that now.

00:14.850 --> 00:17.820
So, we are in our github slash,

00:17.820 --> 00:21.480
github.com/stacksimplify git repository.

00:21.480 --> 00:24.060
So in that, there is one repository called

00:24.060 --> 00:26.580
Docker-fundamentals.

00:26.580 --> 00:27.930
So if you go inside,

00:27.930 --> 00:31.590
we have a five sections involved in this understanding

00:31.590 --> 00:34.860
and then learning the Docker fundamentals, okay?

00:34.860 --> 00:37.980
So we are going to first understand what is Docker

00:37.980 --> 00:40.530
and then in traditional approach

00:40.530 --> 00:42.690
what are the problems we are having

00:42.690 --> 00:46.290
and then why, with the Docker how we are going to solve it.

00:46.290 --> 00:49.050
And we are going to understand the Docker terminology

00:49.050 --> 00:51.240
or Docker architecture.

00:51.240 --> 00:53.850
So once all that is covered in first section

00:53.850 --> 00:56.970
then we'll move on to the Docker installation.

00:56.970 --> 00:58.500
So in Docker installation,

00:58.500 --> 01:01.950
we'll focus on installation on Windows, Mac

01:01.950 --> 01:05.760
and also troubleshooting Docker desktop issues on Mac.

01:05.760 --> 01:09.300
So from there on, we'll move on to two major flows,

01:09.300 --> 01:12.540
which are more essential for understanding the Docker.

01:12.540 --> 01:16.350
So the primary flow is like pull a Docker image

01:16.350 --> 01:19.020
from Docker hub and then run the Docker image

01:19.020 --> 01:20.070
as a container.

01:20.070 --> 01:22.800
So we have existing Docker images available

01:22.800 --> 01:24.540
for different applications

01:24.540 --> 01:25.980
and then how we need to pull that

01:25.980 --> 01:28.800
and then run it on our local Docker machine.

01:28.800 --> 01:29.970
We are going to see it.

01:29.970 --> 01:34.290
In addition, the flow two is like build a new Docker image

01:34.290 --> 01:36.090
and then run it locally

01:36.090 --> 01:38.700
and then again push it back to the Docker hub.

01:38.700 --> 01:40.230
So how we are going to do that?

01:40.230 --> 01:42.990
So if we understand basic these two flows.

01:42.990 --> 01:44.880
So we are very good with the Docker

01:44.880 --> 01:47.640
in the sense like we got the fundamentals thoroughly.

01:47.640 --> 01:52.440
In addition, we'll also focus on essential Docker commands.

01:52.440 --> 01:54.480
So the Docker architecture what we are seeing

01:54.480 --> 01:56.670
already covered in Docker introduction.

01:56.670 --> 01:59.490
So we really don't need to worry about it, okay?

01:59.490 --> 02:01.800
But the core thing is we are also going to focus on

02:01.800 --> 02:04.110
essential Docker commands on day to day life

02:04.110 --> 02:08.430
what we are going to use when we are using the Docker.

02:08.430 --> 02:11.580
So this is the core things we are going to perform now.

02:11.580 --> 02:13.500
So I'll see you in the next lecture

02:13.500 --> 02:15.570
with the Docker introduction.

02:15.570 --> 02:16.800
Until then, bye bye.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.633
Thank you.
