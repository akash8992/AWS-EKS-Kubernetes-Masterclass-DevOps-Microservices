00:00.150 --> 00:00.983
-: Welcome back.

00:00.983 --> 00:03.420
So in this lecture we are going to look into

00:03.420 --> 00:05.820
Docker installation.

00:05.820 --> 00:08.610
Okay, so from Docker installation's perspective.

00:08.610 --> 00:11.020
So let's click on the Docker install

00:13.110 --> 00:17.130
And we can see here so we can install the Docker engine

00:17.130 --> 00:19.920
and then it is supported in different platforms, Okay?

00:19.920 --> 00:22.710
So centOS, Debian, Fedora, and then Ubuntu

00:22.710 --> 00:27.330
and with x86, AMD64, ARM, ARM64, IBM Power,

00:27.330 --> 00:29.340
and then IBM Z series.

00:29.340 --> 00:30.863
So this is more or less like a

00:30.863 --> 00:33.030
docking engine directly installed on those

00:33.030 --> 00:34.920
respective operating systems.

00:34.920 --> 00:38.970
So in addition we have something called Docker Desktop.

00:38.970 --> 00:40.770
So we have the server version

00:40.770 --> 00:42.930
and also we have the desktop version.

00:42.930 --> 00:44.910
So from server versions perspective

00:44.910 --> 00:47.400
all these operating systems are supported

00:47.400 --> 00:50.400
and these models are supported.

00:50.400 --> 00:54.930
Okay, so x86, 64 or AMD 64, ARM, all those things.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.910
So now from Desktop's perspective

00:56.910 --> 01:00.120
so we can install Docker desktop for Mac on MacOS

01:00.120 --> 01:04.080
and also Docker desktop for Windows on Microsoft Windows 10.

01:04.080 --> 01:08.040
So let's see, start with the windows, right?

01:08.040 --> 01:10.770
So when we click on that Windows, so you can see here

01:10.770 --> 01:13.230
get started with Docker for Windows.

01:13.230 --> 01:16.020
So we can directly install the Docker desktop

01:16.020 --> 01:17.580
on our Windows Machine

01:17.580 --> 01:21.090
and then test these things using these steps.

01:21.090 --> 01:24.600
So let's click on install Docker desktop for Windows.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.210
So we have the system requirements here.

01:27.210 --> 01:29.880
Our system should have Windows 10 64 bit

01:29.880 --> 01:32.280
pro, enterprise or education versions

01:32.280 --> 01:34.440
and we should have the HyperV

01:34.440 --> 01:37.380
and then container, HyperV and containers Windows feature

01:37.380 --> 01:39.810
must be enabled on our operating system,

01:39.810 --> 01:41.700
means like at the OS level, Okay?

01:41.700 --> 01:45.000
So now our machine should minimum have

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
4GB of system RAM to operate or run this Docker desktop.

01:50.370 --> 01:53.280
Right, so once those are ready

01:53.280 --> 01:56.100
so we can download the Docker desktop installer dot exe

01:56.100 --> 01:57.780
and then run it, Okay?

01:57.780 --> 01:59.940
So we can start the Docker desktop

01:59.940 --> 02:02.070
and then we can start using it, okay?

02:02.070 --> 02:02.970
So you can see here

02:02.970 --> 02:05.280
and then you can run the Microsoft Power shell.

02:05.280 --> 02:09.030
and then from there you can run the Docker run, Hello world.

02:09.030 --> 02:10.980
Right, and then you can test it.

02:10.980 --> 02:13.110
So in addition to that from Docker desktop only

02:13.110 --> 02:16.260
you can even log into your Docker hub id, okay?

02:16.260 --> 02:19.050
So that's about the Windows installation.

02:19.050 --> 02:21.240
So this Docker desktop is going to be pretty easy

02:21.240 --> 02:22.410
from install perspective

02:22.410 --> 02:25.530
if you have the exact system requirements.

02:25.530 --> 02:29.670
So primarily like if your system is of Windows 64 bit

02:29.670 --> 02:31.230
and then Windows 10 you are running

02:31.230 --> 02:34.800
and at least you have 4GB system RAM, then it is good, okay?

02:34.800 --> 02:36.750
But from my observation

02:36.750 --> 02:39.630
what I'm saying is usually 4GB system RAM

02:39.630 --> 02:41.670
if you install this Docker desktop

02:41.670 --> 02:44.040
then your system will be at the disaster.

02:44.040 --> 02:48.120
This is the live experience whatever I am having, okay?

02:48.120 --> 02:50.093
So ensure that your system has 8GB RAM,

02:50.093 --> 02:53.400
so that you can even leverage that for using other tasks

02:53.400 --> 02:55.350
other than Docker desktop things, okay?

02:55.350 --> 02:57.480
So if it is only 4GB system

02:57.480 --> 02:59.520
then it only supports for Docker desktop.

02:59.520 --> 03:00.600
and then most of the things,

03:00.600 --> 03:02.910
whatever you run either your Spring boot IDE

03:02.910 --> 03:05.910
or Eclipse IDE or whatever you are running there

03:05.910 --> 03:08.100
it is going to be a hell lot of a system,

03:08.100 --> 03:10.620
where it, it'll be very, very slow, okay?

03:10.620 --> 03:13.320
So 8GB ramp is always recommended

03:13.320 --> 03:15.210
even though it says 4GB here

03:15.210 --> 03:18.720
but in real world it's 8GB is recommended.

03:18.720 --> 03:23.220
Okay, So that's about the Docker desktop on Windows.

03:23.220 --> 03:24.810
Okay, So moving on.

03:24.810 --> 03:28.680
So the next thing is Docker desktop on Mac, right?

03:28.680 --> 03:29.880
So if you see here

03:29.880 --> 03:34.020
this is get started with Docker desktop for Mac, right?

03:34.020 --> 03:36.990
So install Docker desktop for Mac.

03:36.990 --> 03:38.550
So let's go there.

03:38.550 --> 03:41.730
And then, so if you see here

03:41.730 --> 03:43.740
so from system requirements perspective,

03:43.740 --> 03:46.560
if you are on the latest OS, it is already supported.

03:46.560 --> 03:50.520
So MacOS must be version 10.13 or even newer.

03:50.520 --> 03:51.840
So this is the thing.

03:51.840 --> 03:55.320
And 4GB of ram, that's what they say as usual.

03:55.320 --> 03:59.160
And virtual box prior to version must not be installed.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.810
So all these things you can ignore, okay?

04:00.810 --> 04:03.150
So with this virtual box and all those things, okay?

04:03.150 --> 04:05.430
So directly download the Docker desktop

04:05.430 --> 04:07.590
and then move to the application folder.

04:07.590 --> 04:10.260
And then once you are move to the application folder,

04:10.260 --> 04:13.800
it'll, it'll be available as a docker.app, okay?

04:13.800 --> 04:15.240
So you can run that.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.550
and then once you run this docker.app

04:17.550 --> 04:20.370
so it'll start displaying here, you can see

04:20.370 --> 04:21.750
you can see it here, right?

04:21.750 --> 04:24.570
So Docker desktop is running on my Docker desktop.

04:24.570 --> 04:27.090
So it'll be available for us to run it,

04:27.090 --> 04:28.500
means like it'll be available for us

04:28.500 --> 04:30.120
to open it from here on, Okay?

04:30.120 --> 04:31.393
So it's engine version, composed version,

04:31.393 --> 04:34.950
Kubernetes version, all these details are provided here.

04:34.950 --> 04:37.710
So once our Docker desktop is up and running

04:37.710 --> 04:38.850
on our Mac machines

04:38.850 --> 04:42.510
so we can go here and then go to the preferences section

04:42.510 --> 04:46.050
and then ensure that this respective setting, okay,

04:46.050 --> 04:49.350
securely store Docker logins in MacOS key chain, okay?

04:49.350 --> 04:51.690
So this setting should be unchecked, okay?

04:51.690 --> 04:54.120
So I already have a running version here,

04:54.120 --> 04:55.260
so I'm not looking into it,

04:55.260 --> 04:57.300
but ideally this setting should be unchecked.

04:57.300 --> 04:59.190
So let's see more about it, okay?

04:59.190 --> 05:01.260
So Docker desktop on Mac has an issue

05:01.260 --> 05:03.570
with the Mac OS key chain, okay?

05:03.570 --> 05:05.640
OS X key chain, okay?

05:05.640 --> 05:09.360
So to fix it, we need to perform these two steps.

05:09.360 --> 05:12.210
So one is go to Doc, Docker desktop changes

05:12.210 --> 05:14.190
open Docker desktop preferences,

05:14.190 --> 05:16.350
which is nothing but whatever we have seen here, right?

05:16.350 --> 05:19.440
In preferences and uncheck the option named

05:19.440 --> 05:22.410
securely store Docker logins in MacOS key chain.

05:22.410 --> 05:24.090
So that is first thing, okay?

05:24.090 --> 05:25.350
And once that is done,

05:25.350 --> 05:28.560
go to the conflict.json file in .docker folder.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.110
So this will be there in your root folder, okay?

05:31.110 --> 05:34.350
So if you go to your users, and then (indistinct)

05:34.350 --> 05:37.677
my, my home user is, my user's home is user (indistinct).

05:38.580 --> 05:41.340
And inside that I'll have a folder called .docker.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.333
And then inside that you'll have something called

05:43.333 --> 05:44.940
config.json, okay?

05:44.940 --> 05:46.530
So currently I removed it earlier

05:46.530 --> 05:48.420
so I am not finding it here

05:48.420 --> 05:51.730
but you'll find some line called cred store OSX key chain

05:51.730 --> 05:55.290
Okay, so this line, okay, so you just need to remove this

05:55.290 --> 05:57.240
and then restart that Docker, okay?

05:57.240 --> 05:58.980
So restart that Docker daemon.

05:58.980 --> 06:02.460
So you can see here, you can see restart, okay?

06:02.460 --> 06:04.200
somewhere it should be there here, yeah.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.700
Restart the Docker daemon.

06:05.700 --> 06:08.910
So when you do that, so this issue will be resolved

06:08.910 --> 06:12.180
if you face any issues related to this OSX key chain

06:12.180 --> 06:14.850
ensure that you are going to troubleshoot

06:14.850 --> 06:18.270
when it is on Mac using following things, okay?

06:18.270 --> 06:19.320
So other than that,

06:19.320 --> 06:21.840
on Mac you are not going to face any other issues.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.250
Only this issue you will face

06:23.250 --> 06:26.070
and then you can fix it using these things, okay?

06:26.070 --> 06:29.280
So in our next lecture we'll focus on our flow one

06:29.280 --> 06:32.790
which is pull from Docker hub and then run the Docker image.

06:32.790 --> 06:34.230
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

06:34.230 --> 06:35.190
Until then, bye bye.

06:35.190 --> 06:36.023
Thank you.
