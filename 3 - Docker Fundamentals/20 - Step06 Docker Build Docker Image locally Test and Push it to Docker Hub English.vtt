00:00.600 --> 00:01.433
-: Welcome back.

00:01.433 --> 00:03.960
In the previous lecture we have completed

00:03.960 --> 00:05.340
about pulling a Docker image

00:05.340 --> 00:08.700
from Docker Hub and then running it on our local mission.

00:08.700 --> 00:12.720
So now in 04 we are going to build a new Docker image

00:12.720 --> 00:14.760
and then run it on locally

00:14.760 --> 00:16.650
and then push it to the Docker hub.

00:16.650 --> 00:20.040
Okay, so let's see how we are going to do it, right?

00:20.040 --> 00:21.900
So as a prerequisite step

00:21.900 --> 00:25.230
please ensure you have your own Docker hub account.

00:25.230 --> 00:26.063
So you can go

00:26.063 --> 00:29.580
to hub.docker.com and then create your account here.

00:29.580 --> 00:33.690
Okay? So you can click on sign up for Docker hub

00:33.690 --> 00:35.700
and then provide your docker ID email

00:35.700 --> 00:38.040
and then password to complete those things.

00:38.040 --> 00:40.710
Okay, so I already have the Docker hub account.

00:40.710 --> 00:44.100
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to log in.

00:44.100 --> 00:45.600
Okay? So sign up

00:45.600 --> 00:48.030
for your Docker Hub account and then put it ready.

00:48.030 --> 00:49.560
Okay, now moving on.

00:49.560 --> 00:50.790
The next thing is to run the

00:50.790 --> 00:53.100
base Nginx container, right?

00:53.100 --> 00:55.620
So why we are going to run the base Nginx container.

00:55.620 --> 00:56.700
What we are going to do

00:56.700 --> 00:59.130
as part of this complete step series

00:59.130 --> 01:02.910
like we have a Nginx docker files folder here.

01:02.910 --> 01:06.570
Inside that you can find docker file and then index.html.

01:06.570 --> 01:09.960
So whenever you run a base Nginx image, it is going to

01:09.960 --> 01:13.560
provide the Nginx related simple index.html.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.780
So what we are going to do is we are going to

01:15.780 --> 01:18.630
change that to a different index dot html

01:18.630 --> 01:19.980
and then so I'm going to

01:19.980 --> 01:23.550
say welcome to stack simplify Nginx V one custom image,

01:23.550 --> 01:25.410
right, in the index.html.

01:25.410 --> 01:29.100
And in my docker file I'm going to say get the base image

01:29.100 --> 01:32.400
from Nginx and then copy my index.html

01:32.400 --> 01:36.960
whatever I have created to the USR share Nginx html, okay?

01:36.960 --> 01:39.480
Which is nothing but inside the image to this location.

01:39.480 --> 01:40.380
Copy it.

01:40.380 --> 01:42.240
And now if I run it

01:42.240 --> 01:44.460
so obviously instead of default Nginx index.html

01:46.501 --> 01:48.862
we are going to get our index start html.

01:48.862 --> 01:50.247
So that image, whatever we are going to build it

01:51.552 --> 01:53.580
we are going to push it to our docker hub.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.710
Okay? So let's see how we are going to do it.

01:55.710 --> 01:59.520
So first before that let's get our base Nginx image

01:59.520 --> 02:01.620
and then run it and then see what it is showing.

02:01.620 --> 02:05.100
Okay, so in our previous step three, means, like in

02:05.100 --> 02:07.260
in section three what we have done is we have

02:07.260 --> 02:09.930
used the docker pool command to get the image

02:09.930 --> 02:11.850
and then run it using Docker run.

02:11.850 --> 02:14.400
But ideally if you want to run it, you can

02:14.400 --> 02:16.140
even without using the docker pool

02:16.140 --> 02:19.230
you can directly use the docker run to do it.

02:19.230 --> 02:22.620
Okay? So what I'm doing here is using docker run

02:22.620 --> 02:24.240
I'm saying - - name

02:24.240 --> 02:26.880
and then I'm saying my Nginx default.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.950
Okay? So my container name I'm giving

02:28.950 --> 02:31.560
as my Nginx default and port mappings

02:31.560 --> 02:35.370
my local host is 80 and also the container port is 80

02:35.370 --> 02:37.170
and the image name is Nginx.

02:37.170 --> 02:40.997
Okay? So you can search for Nginx here, right?

02:42.600 --> 02:44.970
So, and then you get that default Nginx image, okay?

02:44.970 --> 02:47.130
So that one we are going to use.

02:47.130 --> 02:51.540
So I'm going to say docker run Nginx, okay, I'm copying it,

02:51.540 --> 02:55.233
and then going back okay to my terminal and then testing it.

02:56.430 --> 02:58.830
So unable to find the image locally.

02:58.830 --> 03:00.930
So it'll go and then download that image, okay

03:00.930 --> 03:03.300
pulling from the library Nginx.

03:03.300 --> 03:04.560
So once it is downloaded

03:04.560 --> 03:07.350
it is going to automatically start also.

03:07.350 --> 03:09.930
Okay? So it's downloaded and then started.

03:09.930 --> 03:12.330
So let's see, Docker PS, right?

03:12.330 --> 03:14.430
So whenever we see it is already running

03:14.430 --> 03:18.900
so let's go to local host and then see what happens.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.780
Okay? So we can minimize this.

03:21.780 --> 03:24.090
So we can see here we are getting welcome to Nginx.

03:24.090 --> 03:27.966
So this is the default index.html of Nginx.

03:27.966 --> 03:30.150
So we are going to edit it and then change it.

03:30.150 --> 03:32.700
So that's what we are going to build a new docker image.

03:32.700 --> 03:34.920
Very simple docker image we are going to build

03:34.920 --> 03:36.540
with docker file.

03:36.540 --> 03:39.450
So let's see how we are going to do it.

03:39.450 --> 03:42.930
Okay, so let's go here in the step two, create a docker file

03:42.930 --> 03:46.260
and copy our customized index.html here.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.810
So to do so what we are going to do is

03:48.810 --> 03:52.590
so we can go to any of the folders here, okay?

03:52.590 --> 03:57.520
And in documents, I'll create a folder call M K D A R, okay

03:58.890 --> 04:01.020
Nginx image, okay?

04:01.020 --> 04:03.270
Inside that I'm first I'm going to create

04:03.270 --> 04:05.670
that docker file, okay?

04:05.670 --> 04:08.940
So in docker file I'm going to copy these two lines

04:08.940 --> 04:11.340
which is nothing but from Nginx

04:11.340 --> 04:13.170
and then copy the index.html

04:13.170 --> 04:16.170
from local two, this location, right?

04:16.170 --> 04:20.910
So let me copy these two lines and then paste it, right?

04:20.910 --> 04:22.860
So I have created the docker file.

04:22.860 --> 04:26.160
So I also should have the index.html here, right?

04:26.160 --> 04:28.980
So I'll create the index.html

04:28.980 --> 04:33.753
and I'll say welcome to stack simplify.

04:35.490 --> 04:37.590
And I'm going to say Nginx,

04:37.590 --> 04:40.230
I'm not following any HTML standards

04:40.230 --> 04:43.350
or anything here, I'm saying Nginx, V1

04:43.350 --> 04:46.620
and this is going to be a custom image, okay?

04:46.620 --> 04:48.990
And this is a simple file, okay?

04:48.990 --> 04:49.980
Index.html.

04:49.980 --> 04:52.110
So now what we are going to do is we are going to

04:52.110 --> 04:55.710
build a docker image and then run it locally, right?

04:55.710 --> 05:00.710
So docker build -t and then you are dockerhubID/

05:02.550 --> 05:06.390
and your image name and then the tag you are going to use

05:06.390 --> 05:08.880
and where you are going to build it dot, means like

05:08.880 --> 05:11.910
from current location it need to take the docker file

05:11.910 --> 05:15.540
and then also the respective index.html file

05:15.540 --> 05:17.220
that's the reason, dot.

05:17.220 --> 05:19.650
So if it is, in your environment means

05:19.650 --> 05:21.480
like you have your own docker hub ID, right?

05:21.480 --> 05:24.270
So whatever you have created as part of prerequisites

05:24.270 --> 05:26.670
so you need to replace this command

05:26.670 --> 05:28.590
with your docker hub ID here, okay?

05:28.590 --> 05:31.020
So just if, if your docker hub ID is ABC

05:31.020 --> 05:33.000
then just put the ABC here

05:33.000 --> 05:36.060
and then copy this entire thing in there, run it, okay?

05:36.060 --> 05:39.270
So docker and then build the image -t

05:39.270 --> 05:41.370
which is nothing but a tag name, right?

05:41.370 --> 05:46.260
So stack simplifies /myNginx_imageone:V1

05:46.260 --> 05:47.220
and then dot.

05:47.220 --> 05:48.053
So okay, build

05:48.053 --> 05:50.310
from the current location means the current location.

05:50.310 --> 05:51.600
I have that docker file.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.830
So build from there.

05:52.830 --> 05:57.003
Okay, so I'm copying this and then I will run it now.

06:00.180 --> 06:04.110
Okay, so now if I see docker images, my new image, okay

06:04.110 --> 06:05.850
so Nginx already downloaded

06:05.850 --> 06:07.689
and using that it created a tag,

06:07.689 --> 06:09.914
simplifymyNginx_imageone

06:09.914 --> 06:13.680
with V1 tag and it is created four seconds before.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.230
Okay, so now I need to run it, right?

06:16.230 --> 06:18.750
So let me clear this and Docker run

06:18.750 --> 06:21.420
-: -name and my image name is going to

06:21.420 --> 06:25.830
be my Nginx1 and port mapping is 80:80, right?

06:25.830 --> 06:27.180
So if you don't stop this

06:27.180 --> 06:28.680
then we are going to get the error.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.770
So let's go ahead and then stop our earlier one.

06:31.770 --> 06:34.710
So if you see my Nginx default is also using 80

06:34.710 --> 06:36.150
for local mission, right?

06:36.150 --> 06:38.910
So let me stop the old one, okay?

06:38.910 --> 06:41.880
And then now come back here and then run this one.

06:41.880 --> 06:45.930
Okay, so docker run my Nginx1 with port 80:80 and

06:45.930 --> 06:47.370
my image name is

06:47.370 --> 06:50.070
tag simplifies last my Nginx image 1 V1.

06:50.070 --> 06:52.200
Okay, so let's run it in your case

06:52.200 --> 06:55.473
you just replace it with your, your docker ID here, okay?

06:58.440 --> 06:59.730
Okay, you have run it now.

06:59.730 --> 07:03.360
So let's go to local host and then check it.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.953
So it's coming.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.290
Computer: Welcome to voice -

07:07.290 --> 07:08.490
Narrator: One second.

07:09.630 --> 07:12.093
Ideally it should come.

07:14.850 --> 07:16.980
So it's coming from the local cash.

07:16.980 --> 07:18.870
So let me try one more time.

07:18.870 --> 07:20.370
Yeah, so now it is coming.

07:20.370 --> 07:21.270
Okay, so it it came

07:21.270 --> 07:23.820
from the local cash whenever we tried here.

07:23.820 --> 07:25.230
So let me close this.

07:25.230 --> 07:28.110
So welcome to stack simplify Nginx V1 custom

07:28.110 --> 07:29.190
image we have got it.

07:29.190 --> 07:32.130
Okay, so now we have completed building the docker image

07:32.130 --> 07:33.270
and then running it.

07:33.270 --> 07:35.400
Okay? So if you want, you can even stop it.

07:35.400 --> 07:39.150
Okay? So docker PS it is running now

07:39.150 --> 07:43.350
docker stop my Nginx 1, okay?

07:43.350 --> 07:46.620
And if you say docker PS no other containers are running

07:46.620 --> 07:48.030
but the stopper containers

07:48.030 --> 07:51.630
you can see my Nginx 1 and then my Nginx default.

07:51.630 --> 07:53.160
Okay? So if you want to remove them

07:53.160 --> 07:54.870
you can even remove them.

07:54.870 --> 07:59.850
Okay? So I'll say my Nginx 1

07:59.850 --> 08:02.760
and then all these things you can do via additional command.

08:02.760 --> 08:03.593
Now, docker...

08:07.800 --> 08:10.440
PS - a - q, right?

08:10.440 --> 08:12.840
Which is nothing, but you'll give the docker image

08:12.840 --> 08:15.420
docker container IDs, okay?

08:15.420 --> 08:17.670
So you can even remove them using this command.

08:17.670 --> 08:21.990
Okay? So now if you say docker, PS - a, nothing is there.

08:21.990 --> 08:24.240
Okay? So that's the reason why we are going to

08:24.240 --> 08:28.260
use -q is because to get that docker container IDs or

08:28.260 --> 08:31.470
docker image IDs and then pass this output

08:31.470 --> 08:33.090
to another command like this.

08:33.090 --> 08:35.100
Okay? So earlier we discussed this, right?

08:35.100 --> 08:37.380
So for that purpose I have excluded this command

08:37.380 --> 08:38.850
and then shown it even

08:38.850 --> 08:41.040
though it is not in our current things, okay.

08:41.040 --> 08:42.000
So now moving on,

08:42.000 --> 08:44.850
we are going to tag and push the docker image to docker hub.

08:44.850 --> 08:47.040
So currently our docker image name is

08:47.040 --> 08:50.430
myNginx_image1:V1 okay?

08:50.430 --> 08:52.590
So, but what I felt is like

08:52.590 --> 08:55.050
or V1 is not my, not looks good.

08:55.050 --> 08:57.450
So we'll say we want - release, okay?

08:57.450 --> 09:00.990
So then if I want to change my docker images tag name

09:00.990 --> 09:03.900
then we can use that docker tag, right?

09:03.900 --> 09:06.150
So docker tag command to do that.

09:06.150 --> 09:08.220
So let's do that now.

09:08.220 --> 09:10.080
So docker images

09:10.080 --> 09:13.272
and we'll have the tag simplify myNginx image one.

09:13.272 --> 09:15.404
So let's say docker tag

09:15.404 --> 09:18.060
and then stack simplify my Nginx image V1

09:18.060 --> 09:20.220
change it to V1 - release.

09:20.220 --> 09:22.953
Okay? So let's change that.

09:25.290 --> 09:28.170
Right, and if you see the images,

09:28.170 --> 09:31.080
so now you have both V1 and then also V1 release.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.270
Okay? So now let's push the V1 release

09:33.270 --> 09:36.390
to our Docker hub account.

09:36.390 --> 09:39.390
Okay, in your case, please replace your docker hub ID

09:39.390 --> 09:43.020
at every place wherever you see the stack simplify, right?

09:43.020 --> 09:44.943
So now I'm going to push this.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.940
Okay, it is pushing to my docker hub.

09:50.940 --> 09:52.500
So let's see once it is pushed.

09:52.500 --> 09:53.940
Okay, so let's go here,

09:53.940 --> 09:55.710
docker hub, right?

09:55.710 --> 09:59.400
So this is my dockor hub and my repositories are here.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.800
So let's wait for it to be completely pushed,

10:01.800 --> 10:03.780
and once it is pushed we can crosscheck

10:03.780 --> 10:06.990
whether it is available on our docker hub repositories

10:06.990 --> 10:07.823
or not.

10:07.823 --> 10:09.900
Okay? It is pushed now, okay so lets see.

10:09.900 --> 10:13.500
The next step is to verify the same on the docker hub.

10:13.500 --> 10:16.353
Okay, so let's go here and then refresh it.

10:18.660 --> 10:21.000
And you can see my Nginx_image1

10:21.000 --> 10:23.730
just now came updated a few seconds ago

10:23.730 --> 10:27.270
and you can see the tag name is V1 -release.

10:27.270 --> 10:31.530
So this completes the creation of a new docker image

10:31.530 --> 10:35.190
run it as a container and then push to the docker hub.

10:35.190 --> 10:38.490
Okay? So we have seen that in a series of five steps.

10:38.490 --> 10:40.710
Okay? So I'll see you in the next lecture.

10:40.710 --> 10:42.060
Until then, bye bye.

10:42.060 --> 10:42.893
Thank you.
