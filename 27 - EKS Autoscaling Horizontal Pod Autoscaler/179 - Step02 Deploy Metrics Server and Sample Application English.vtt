00:00.240 --> 00:01.110
-: Welcome back.

00:01.110 --> 00:03.334
We are in the section 15,

00:03.334 --> 00:06.930
EKS HPA Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.

00:06.930 --> 00:08.610
So just now, we have looked into

00:08.610 --> 00:09.690
the introductory part,

00:09.690 --> 00:12.219
what is Horizontal Pod Autoscaling,

00:12.219 --> 00:13.052
how it works,

00:13.052 --> 00:14.850
and then how it is configured.

00:14.850 --> 00:15.683
So, the first thing

00:15.683 --> 00:17.790
we need to install in our cluster

00:17.790 --> 00:20.430
is install the Metrics Server.

00:20.430 --> 00:21.263
Okay?

00:21.263 --> 00:22.380
So the current version,

00:22.380 --> 00:25.200
which is live is v0.3.6.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.310
But if you want to go

00:26.310 --> 00:27.240
to the latest version

00:27.240 --> 00:28.860
and use the latest version,

00:28.860 --> 00:30.990
so here is the releases in the references

00:30.990 --> 00:33.570
you have the metric server releases section,

00:33.570 --> 00:35.040
so you can go there.

00:35.040 --> 00:39.720
And so, if you see the latest releases 0.3.6, okay?

00:39.720 --> 00:42.060
And, at 17th April they have 3.7,

00:42.060 --> 00:44.340
but they still didn't make it as

00:44.340 --> 00:46.080
live release for us, okay?

00:46.080 --> 00:47.670
So, now we are using that one,

00:47.670 --> 00:49.740
but whenever you are doing this course

00:49.740 --> 00:51.990
and then if you want to crosscheck this command

00:51.990 --> 00:53.850
to be a different value here,

00:53.850 --> 00:55.380
so go to this releases section

00:55.380 --> 00:58.530
and then crosscheck what is the latest release.

00:58.530 --> 01:01.140
So, verify whatever this means,

01:01.140 --> 01:03.360
like verify if metric server is installed

01:03.360 --> 01:06.090
on our respective Kube System, okay?

01:06.090 --> 01:07.710
So let's go here,

01:07.710 --> 01:10.890
and verify it first, okay?

01:10.890 --> 01:12.900
So there should not be any metric server

01:12.900 --> 01:14.490
in our existing cluster.

01:14.490 --> 01:15.480
So we can go ahead

01:15.480 --> 01:19.470
and then install the Metrics Server.

01:19.470 --> 01:21.300
So let me paste it,

01:21.300 --> 01:25.680
and it should install the 0.3.6 Metrics Server, okay?

01:25.680 --> 01:26.880
So it'll create equal

01:26.880 --> 01:28.170
and cluster roll bindings

01:28.170 --> 01:30.330
and then all the related stuff.

01:30.330 --> 01:31.163
And then,

01:31.163 --> 01:33.330
so now it is installed.

01:33.330 --> 01:35.968
So if I say 'kubectl', right?

01:35.968 --> 01:38.760
'get pods-n

01:38.760 --> 01:41.940
Kube-system' right?

01:41.940 --> 01:44.760
So we can verify the same thing.

01:44.760 --> 01:46.920
See, we can see that Metrics Server

01:46.920 --> 01:48.180
is up and running

01:48.180 --> 01:52.200
in our Kube System name space, right?

01:52.200 --> 01:53.033
So if you want,

01:53.033 --> 01:55.740
you can even verify that deployment is available

01:55.740 --> 01:59.220
for us, not using deployment command, okay?

01:59.220 --> 02:01.890
So Metrics Server deployment is successful.

02:01.890 --> 02:02.790
So the next thing is,

02:02.790 --> 02:04.800
deploy our application, okay?

02:04.800 --> 02:07.800
So let me refresh here once, okay,

02:07.800 --> 02:09.210
so yeah.

02:09.210 --> 02:11.430
So deploy our application.

02:11.430 --> 02:12.630
So before deploying it

02:12.630 --> 02:15.150
we are going to review our template, right?

02:15.150 --> 02:17.160
So let me go here,

02:17.160 --> 02:19.260
and if you see here

02:19.260 --> 02:23.430
so this is my EKS HPA Horizontal Pod Autoscaler,

02:23.430 --> 02:25.587
so this is the 'HPAdemo.yml'.

02:26.490 --> 02:27.840
So if you see it here,

02:27.840 --> 02:29.580
this is a standard deployment

02:29.580 --> 02:30.810
whatever we have created

02:30.810 --> 02:32.640
and it's SQL NodePort service

02:32.640 --> 02:34.560
with 31231, also,

02:34.560 --> 02:36.570
we have created.

02:36.570 --> 02:39.930
So the image here is simple Kube NGINX image,

02:39.930 --> 02:42.510
so which we have used in our initial sections

02:42.510 --> 02:44.190
of the course, the same thing.

02:44.190 --> 02:45.210
Only thing here,

02:45.210 --> 02:48.030
we have also provided the resources section

02:48.030 --> 02:50.610
with the, how much memory it need to use,

02:50.610 --> 02:52.950
and then how much it is limited for it, okay?

02:52.950 --> 02:55.290
So it can go max till 200M,

02:55.290 --> 02:57.720
and then after that it cannot move on.

02:57.720 --> 03:00.090
So like this, we have also defined the resources

03:00.090 --> 03:02.430
for this respective deployment,

03:02.430 --> 03:06.330
nothing but for this respective HPA NGINX application.

03:06.330 --> 03:08.010
So this means,

03:08.010 --> 03:10.860
like metrics should have something right here,

03:10.860 --> 03:12.870
so in consideration with metrics

03:12.870 --> 03:14.250
we are going to enable.

03:14.250 --> 03:16.650
So as we already deployed the metrics

03:16.650 --> 03:17.880
so in equivalent with that

03:17.880 --> 03:21.300
the resources also we have defined our deployment.

03:21.300 --> 03:22.440
So let's move on,

03:22.440 --> 03:25.520
and then deploy the manifest, okay?

03:25.520 --> 03:27.000
So we are here,

03:27.000 --> 03:28.740
and then we'll go to 15

03:28.740 --> 03:32.280
which is EKA HPA Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

03:32.280 --> 03:34.230
and I'm going to say 'kubectl

03:34.230 --> 03:37.203
apply-F Kube manifest', right?

03:39.150 --> 03:42.177
So 'kubectl get pods',

03:43.260 --> 03:44.220
should give the pod

03:44.220 --> 03:48.120
and HPA demo deployment is up and running for us.

03:48.120 --> 03:52.200
So, if you say 'kubectl get SVC'

03:52.200 --> 03:53.820
should give the services

03:53.820 --> 03:55.470
where it will say that it is running

03:55.470 --> 03:59.100
on 31231, this HPA demo service.

03:59.100 --> 04:04.100
And 'kubectl get nodes-no wide', right?

04:05.580 --> 04:08.490
So our deployment is present

04:08.490 --> 04:10.830
in our private subnet,

04:10.830 --> 04:12.660
so we are not able to access

04:12.660 --> 04:14.940
this application externally,

04:14.940 --> 04:18.330
but you can generate the load internally.

04:18.330 --> 04:20.610
But even though we deployed our application,

04:20.610 --> 04:23.010
so we know that if it is only

04:23.010 --> 04:24.690
our cluster is in public subnets

04:24.690 --> 04:28.050
we will be able to access via NodePorts, right?

04:28.050 --> 04:29.160
So that's fine, okay,

04:29.160 --> 04:30.750
we can even deploy a load balancer

04:30.750 --> 04:33.570
type of service, and then even access it.

04:33.570 --> 04:35.220
But our core focus here

04:35.220 --> 04:37.350
is on Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

04:37.350 --> 04:40.290
and not anything related to other stuff.

04:40.290 --> 04:41.460
So what we are going to do

04:41.460 --> 04:43.230
is like, in our next lecture,

04:43.230 --> 04:46.080
we'll focus on enabling the Pod Autoscaler

04:46.080 --> 04:48.960
and then generating the load and then test it.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.760
So, I'll see you in the next lecture.

04:50.760 --> 04:52.140
Until then, bye bye.

04:52.140 --> 04:52.973
Thank you.
