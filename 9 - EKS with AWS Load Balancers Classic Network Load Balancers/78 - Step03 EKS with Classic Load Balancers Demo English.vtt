00:00.300 --> 00:01.320
-: Welcome back.

00:01.320 --> 00:05.040
In this lecture we are going to implement this entire thing.

00:05.040 --> 00:08.160
So which is nothing but audio's database is already created

00:08.160 --> 00:10.410
and then ready for us.

00:10.410 --> 00:11.850
So what we are going to do is,

00:11.850 --> 00:16.590
we are going to deploy the MySQL external name service,

00:16.590 --> 00:19.590
and our user management deployment.

00:19.590 --> 00:21.350
And also we are going to write

00:21.350 --> 00:25.440
a classic load balancer service cube and it is manifest.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.290
And then deploy all these three things

00:28.290 --> 00:32.490
and then ensure that everything is working as expected,

00:32.490 --> 00:36.150
for us when we access our application via browser.

00:36.150 --> 00:40.290
So let's go ahead and then do that now.

00:40.290 --> 00:43.650
So we will go back to our browser

00:43.650 --> 00:46.440
and we are going to zero seven zero two

00:46.440 --> 00:50.190
classic load balances CLB, right?

00:50.190 --> 00:51.960
And as a step one,

00:51.960 --> 00:56.100
we are supposed to create our loadbalancer.yml, right?

00:56.100 --> 00:59.400
So let's go back to our visual studio code

00:59.400 --> 01:03.150
and if you see in zero seven zero two in cube manifest.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.100
So we'll have the external name service

01:05.100 --> 01:09.060
which we have copied from our previous RDS database section.

01:09.060 --> 01:11.070
It is going to be same thing.

01:11.070 --> 01:13.740
And user management microservice also no changes

01:13.740 --> 01:17.220
inside that after integrating with the RDS database.

01:17.220 --> 01:19.680
So nothing we are going to copy the same.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.120
Secrets also same.

01:21.120 --> 01:25.170
It is the same and even the load balancer service, right?

01:25.170 --> 01:27.720
Which is nothing, but previously it is a note port service.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.030
The same thing we have copied here.

01:30.030 --> 01:30.863
Okay?

01:30.863 --> 01:32.100
So now what we are going to do

01:32.100 --> 01:34.080
is that respect your note port service.

01:34.080 --> 01:37.080
Whatever we have created as part of RDS service,

01:37.080 --> 01:39.300
means like RDS database integration.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.900
So now we are going to change it to load balancer type.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.430
So what we need to do.

01:44.430 --> 01:48.570
Earlier we used to create a load balance note port service.

01:48.570 --> 01:50.070
So now we are going to create it

01:50.070 --> 01:53.401
as a load balancer type, okay?

01:53.401 --> 01:55.260
Our services, our Kubernetes service.

01:55.260 --> 01:58.200
Whatever we are going to create is a load balancer

01:58.200 --> 02:00.951
and we already know that default.

02:00.951 --> 02:03.240
Whenever we create this manifest

02:03.240 --> 02:05.400
and deploy it in Kubernetes,

02:05.400 --> 02:10.400
it is going to create a classic load balancer by default.

02:10.620 --> 02:13.740
And one more important thing here is.

02:13.740 --> 02:16.830
Because we are using the load balancer type,

02:16.830 --> 02:19.950
we really don't need to mention this note put here.

02:19.950 --> 02:20.783
Okay?

02:20.783 --> 02:21.810
So that one is remote

02:21.810 --> 02:24.900
and the type is load balancer is implemented.

02:24.900 --> 02:25.733
So done.

02:25.733 --> 02:28.080
Okay, so this default is going to be CLB.

02:28.080 --> 02:32.022
And now one more important thing here is port.

02:32.022 --> 02:32.855
Okay?

02:32.855 --> 02:36.360
So eight zero nine five browser also you can say.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.300
CLB DNS URL colon eight zero nine five,

02:39.300 --> 02:42.930
or you can even use the listener portals J key.

02:42.930 --> 02:46.740
So which means like browser default port, right?

02:46.740 --> 02:49.290
Means like you really don't need to provide any port there.

02:49.290 --> 02:52.050
So you can use J key in addition to that,

02:52.050 --> 02:55.200
if you want to change the name of your service, right?

02:55.200 --> 02:58.593
So little bit like CLB user management.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.223
Rest app, something like this, okay?

03:03.432 --> 03:05.370
CLB user management rest app.

03:05.370 --> 03:08.580
And if you want you can even add service whatever you want.

03:08.580 --> 03:09.413
Okay?

03:09.413 --> 03:11.160
So I'll say CLB which is nothing,

03:11.160 --> 03:14.640
but classic load balancer user management rest app.

03:14.640 --> 03:15.473
So that's all.

03:15.473 --> 03:16.950
We have done only three changes.

03:16.950 --> 03:18.870
One is very more than note port here

03:18.870 --> 03:20.160
from our note port service

03:20.160 --> 03:22.740
and we ensure that the type is going to be load balancer.

03:22.740 --> 03:24.450
Which means we remove the note port here

03:24.450 --> 03:26.640
and then add a load balancer.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.700
And then we change the port to browser default port.

03:29.700 --> 03:32.160
So whenever we access our load balancer

03:32.160 --> 03:35.040
will be created with a listener port 80, right?

03:35.040 --> 03:36.180
Our service port is nothing

03:36.180 --> 03:38.580
but our load balancer port here right?

03:38.580 --> 03:40.110
So which means on a browser,

03:40.110 --> 03:42.150
you really don't need to give eight zero nine five,

03:42.150 --> 03:42.990
something like that.

03:42.990 --> 03:43.823
Okay?

03:43.823 --> 03:45.060
So that's about it.

03:45.060 --> 03:46.650
Now this is completed.

03:46.650 --> 03:49.800
It'll go to our next step here.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.320
Which is nothing but deploy this manifest.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.153
Okay?

03:53.153 --> 03:56.220
So I'm going to edit this section little bit.

03:56.220 --> 03:59.040
So ideally this should be cube hyphen manifests here.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.830
So I didn't edit that.

04:01.830 --> 04:02.780
Now I have edited it.

04:02.780 --> 04:04.440
It should be good now.

04:04.440 --> 04:07.470
So now let's go ahead and then deploy it, okay?

04:07.470 --> 04:12.407
So we'll go to zero seven and inside zero seven,

04:12.407 --> 04:16.620
we are going to go to zero seven zero two, right?

04:16.620 --> 04:21.030
And inside that we are going to say Q CTL

04:21.030 --> 04:24.570
apply hyphen F cube manifest.

04:24.570 --> 04:27.570
So where we have all the files there, okay?

04:27.570 --> 04:31.830
So now it is going to first create our MySQL service

04:31.830 --> 04:35.010
and also do the user management microservice deployment

04:35.010 --> 04:37.470
and it's a secrets thing.

04:37.470 --> 04:41.460
And also deploy the CLB user management rest app service.

04:41.460 --> 04:42.780
Okay?

04:42.780 --> 04:47.780
So now we can say get SVC, should create a load balancer.

04:48.450 --> 04:51.540
And it also provided the load balancer URL here, right?

04:51.540 --> 04:55.200
You can see and the port is EAT, okay?

04:55.200 --> 04:58.560
So now it also created the external name service also.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.510
Whatever we have implemented.

05:00.510 --> 05:03.330
So let me clear Q CTL.

05:03.330 --> 05:06.510
I'll say get ports here, okay?

05:06.510 --> 05:08.640
And it's waiting for two come up.

05:08.640 --> 05:12.040
So if you want we can parallelly check the logs

05:14.740 --> 05:15.753
of our application.

05:18.660 --> 05:20.100
So it came up successfully.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.750
No issues with the database.

05:21.750 --> 05:26.527
So Q CTL get SVC.

05:29.700 --> 05:30.736
Right?

05:30.736 --> 05:32.790
So this is the load balancer.

05:32.790 --> 05:34.260
Usually it'll take some time

05:34.260 --> 05:36.930
to get the load balancer pinned up, created

05:36.930 --> 05:38.850
and then available for us.

05:38.850 --> 05:43.830
So let's go here and go to EKS.

05:43.830 --> 05:47.160
Now we'll go to service, easy to service,

05:47.160 --> 05:51.660
and inside that we'll go to left navigation load balances.

05:51.660 --> 05:52.493
Okay?

05:52.493 --> 05:56.250
So network and security load balancing, load balances.

05:56.250 --> 06:00.720
So now you can see here the classic load balancer

06:00.720 --> 06:01.710
is getting created.

06:01.710 --> 06:04.950
You can see type is classic, right?

06:04.950 --> 06:07.350
And states still not available for us.

06:07.350 --> 06:08.790
So we can wait.

06:08.790 --> 06:11.820
So instances is out of disturb but they're out of service,

06:11.820 --> 06:14.820
because of maybe our port is still coming up.

06:14.820 --> 06:18.510
Once it comes up it'll take a while to register

06:18.510 --> 06:19.620
and then ready.

06:19.620 --> 06:20.920
So let's wait for a while.

06:22.410 --> 06:24.000
So it is in service now.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.650
So it is available for us.

06:25.650 --> 06:28.230
So health checks are passing.

06:28.230 --> 06:30.900
So we can copy the DNS name from here.

06:30.900 --> 06:32.160
Whatever is provided, right?

06:32.160 --> 06:34.920
So this is the DNS name off of our ALB.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.516
So you can, we can directly use this

06:37.516 --> 06:42.516
or we can even copy the DNS name from this section, okay?

06:43.320 --> 06:47.820
And copy this, and we can go to browser,

06:47.820 --> 06:52.777
and say that DNS URL slash user MGMT

06:54.390 --> 06:59.390
slash health hyphen status, right?

06:59.550 --> 07:03.780
So we can see it, user management services open running.

07:03.780 --> 07:07.140
Want to even test the entire flow till the RDS database.

07:07.140 --> 07:09.000
So we can even go to our postman

07:09.000 --> 07:11.370
and then create a user and then test it.

07:11.370 --> 07:12.990
So first to list the users.

07:12.990 --> 07:16.530
So there should not be any users available by default.

07:16.530 --> 07:18.900
So let me cancel this.

07:18.900 --> 07:22.320
So first we need to provide the environment here, right?

07:22.320 --> 07:24.120
So let's go to settings

07:24.120 --> 07:29.120
and then add a environment and it should be URL, right?

07:30.240 --> 07:33.090
And we are going to say CLB, right?

07:33.090 --> 07:36.960
And we are going to say http://,

07:36.960 --> 07:40.680
the entire AB DNS URL, right?

07:40.680 --> 07:43.230
And then add it right?

07:43.230 --> 07:47.343
And close it and go to CLB environment, okay?

07:48.210 --> 07:50.100
And let me close this.

07:50.100 --> 07:50.940
Close this

07:50.940 --> 07:53.640
Let's close everything here,

07:53.640 --> 07:57.900
and we'll go to list users once and then test it.

07:57.900 --> 07:58.733
Okay?

07:58.733 --> 08:00.180
The environment we have selected CLB,

08:00.180 --> 08:03.090
which is nothing but classic load balancer.

08:03.090 --> 08:06.750
So nothing 200, no, no data available inside that.

08:06.750 --> 08:09.930
So let's go ahead and then create a user now, okay?

08:09.930 --> 08:12.480
So it is going to create a admin to user.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.100
So let's create it.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.500
So user created and the error is related

08:16.500 --> 08:19.110
to notification service we can ignore.

08:19.110 --> 08:21.810
And one more time list services.

08:21.810 --> 08:25.110
And we should have the user available for us.

08:25.110 --> 08:26.970
So which completes the entire flow.

08:26.970 --> 08:28.530
Which means from your browser,

08:28.530 --> 08:30.390
you have access to the load balancer.

08:30.390 --> 08:33.510
And then load balancer has forwarded the request

08:33.510 --> 08:35.040
to one of the pod here.

08:35.040 --> 08:36.630
And this pod has been sent

08:36.630 --> 08:39.870
to the MySQL external name service.

08:39.870 --> 08:42.780
And from external name service, we went to RDS DB,

08:42.780 --> 08:46.650
and then created that respective user.

08:46.650 --> 08:49.830
So entire flow we have tested.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.320
So in our next lecture,

08:52.320 --> 08:55.470
we'll focus on network load balancer.

08:55.470 --> 08:58.260
So far now we'll go ahead and then delete all these things.

08:58.260 --> 08:59.093
Okay?

08:59.093 --> 09:01.710
So I'll change this also to cube manifest.

09:01.710 --> 09:03.150
So not an issue.

09:03.150 --> 09:06.660
So let's go back here, and cube seat here,

09:06.660 --> 09:10.440
and delete high fund half, and then cube manifest

09:10.440 --> 09:12.600
And everything whatever we have created

09:12.600 --> 09:14.700
should get deleted now.

09:14.700 --> 09:18.180
So from Kubernetes you have created

09:18.180 --> 09:21.060
the classic load balancer in AWS

09:21.060 --> 09:23.910
and then you are also deleting the classic load balancer

09:23.910 --> 09:25.050
in AWS.

09:25.050 --> 09:27.570
So we really didn't touch any management console.

09:27.570 --> 09:30.060
We didn't create anything here, okay?

09:30.060 --> 09:32.730
So everything is automatic for a C.

09:32.730 --> 09:34.290
Now everything is gone.

09:34.290 --> 09:35.370
So once we delete it

09:35.370 --> 09:38.640
and our classic load balancer also got deleted.

09:38.640 --> 09:42.330
So this completes the classic load balancer demo

09:42.330 --> 09:45.840
and then we'll see the network load balancer demo shortly.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.400
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.570
Until then, bye bye.

09:48.570 --> 09:49.403
Thank you.
