00:00.270 --> 00:01.710
-: Welcome back.

00:01.710 --> 00:03.690
In this lecture, we are going to discuss

00:03.690 --> 00:05.460
about the Kubernetes manifest

00:05.460 --> 00:08.100
related to user management microservice,

00:08.100 --> 00:10.200
and then notification-microservice

00:10.200 --> 00:13.567
and also our ALB Ingress service.

00:13.567 --> 00:16.170
So step four, five, six,

00:16.170 --> 00:18.570
and then seven and then eight.

00:18.570 --> 00:21.960
So all these four steps are primarily related

00:21.960 --> 00:23.670
to this manifest only.

00:23.670 --> 00:25.140
So, let's start with step four,

00:25.140 --> 00:27.060
which is create notification

00:27.060 --> 00:29.820
microservice deployment manifest, right?

00:29.820 --> 00:33.240
So, I have created everything and then put it ready here.

00:33.240 --> 00:35.220
So, it's a standard deployment manifest.

00:35.220 --> 00:37.560
So, we really didn't add anything special here

00:37.560 --> 00:40.230
but we'll go and then review it step by step.

00:40.230 --> 00:42.210
Okay, so let's go to...

00:42.210 --> 00:45.690
if you see here 01, 02, 03 to 07

00:45.690 --> 00:49.020
are our templates in 12 microservices deployment

00:49.020 --> 00:51.689
on EKS and inside that queue manifests, okay?

00:51.689 --> 00:53.880
So you know that 01 is related

00:53.880 --> 00:56.520
to our MySQL external name service.

00:56.520 --> 00:59.880
And then you need to replace your external name here

00:59.880 --> 01:02.730
related to your RDS database.

01:02.730 --> 01:06.522
So, whatever the RDS database endpoint is present with you,

01:06.522 --> 01:10.020
so you need to replace this value.

01:10.020 --> 01:11.070
So, let me go there

01:11.070 --> 01:13.710
and then show you that one more time, okay?

01:13.710 --> 01:16.620
So this endpoint you need to replace here.

01:16.620 --> 01:18.270
So this is the endpoint information

01:18.270 --> 01:20.370
what you need to replace in 01.

01:20.370 --> 01:23.760
And user management microservices deployment,

01:23.760 --> 01:25.170
we are not going to touch this.

01:25.170 --> 01:27.000
First, we'll go back to notification

01:27.000 --> 01:28.650
and then come back to user management.

01:28.650 --> 01:31.740
Okay, so this is user management microservice deployment

01:31.740 --> 01:34.170
and this is user management node port service, okay?

01:34.170 --> 01:35.880
Those two are standard ones, okay?

01:35.880 --> 01:38.490
So, now we'll go to notification

01:38.490 --> 01:40.500
microservice deployment.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.140
So, if you see here API version, kind, metadata

01:43.140 --> 01:45.180
are standard stuff here, right?

01:45.180 --> 01:46.500
And inside deployment,

01:46.500 --> 01:48.720
you know that we will have spec, replica,

01:48.720 --> 01:50.740
selector and then port template, okay?

01:50.740 --> 01:53.250
So, selector will have the match labels

01:53.250 --> 01:56.850
with whatever is presenting port template label.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.020
This is same, okay?

01:58.020 --> 01:59.070
So, that is good.

01:59.070 --> 02:03.570
And replicas, we know that we are going to have two replicas

02:03.570 --> 02:05.760
of our application, right?

02:05.760 --> 02:07.500
So, we can have two or one.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.270
Whatever we want we can have it.

02:09.270 --> 02:10.320
Okay, So that's fine.

02:10.320 --> 02:13.140
So, I'm just having it one for now.

02:13.140 --> 02:16.710
So, now the next thing is in PodTemplateSpec

02:16.710 --> 02:18.459
you are going to have the container name

02:18.459 --> 02:21.570
and then images whatever we have discussed here,

02:21.570 --> 02:25.590
right in our section related to images stack.

02:25.590 --> 02:29.730
Simplify cube notification-microservice 1.0.0.

02:29.730 --> 02:31.560
And for user management

02:31.560 --> 02:33.750
you have seen already in multiple sections

02:33.750 --> 02:36.870
it is going to be 809 (indistinct) the port.

02:36.870 --> 02:40.080
So, here it is going to be 8096.

02:40.080 --> 02:43.110
So here, one additional thing I have added

02:43.110 --> 02:45.710
it is image-pull-policy always, okay?

02:45.710 --> 02:46.950
So you can remove it.

02:46.950 --> 02:49.050
So, what this does is whenever you are doing

02:49.050 --> 02:51.510
the notification-microservice deployment,

02:51.510 --> 02:55.110
immediately even though it is present in your worker notes,

02:55.110 --> 02:56.610
that respect to image,

02:56.610 --> 02:59.070
so it is going to download it from Docker hub.

02:59.070 --> 03:01.590
So, just to add some additional option to let you know

03:01.590 --> 03:03.510
that we will have in container definition,

03:03.510 --> 03:06.180
something like image pool policy.

03:06.180 --> 03:09.990
So, always means it is going to go to Docker hub

03:09.990 --> 03:12.480
and then pull that image to these worker notes

03:12.480 --> 03:16.170
and then use that image from worker notes

03:16.170 --> 03:18.030
So, if this option is not there,

03:18.030 --> 03:19.860
what it is going to do is like,

03:19.860 --> 03:22.740
so it is going to use

03:22.740 --> 03:26.400
whatever previously downloaded notification service image,

03:26.400 --> 03:29.130
Okay, with whatever the same tag is available.

03:29.130 --> 03:30.270
So, that's about it.

03:30.270 --> 03:33.330
And now you can see it here and we are on mental variables

03:33.330 --> 03:35.610
whatever we discussed, right?

03:35.610 --> 03:37.410
So, these are the things, okay?

03:37.410 --> 03:39.450
Mail server, host, username, password,

03:39.450 --> 03:40.650
and then from address.

03:40.650 --> 03:42.900
So, let me copy that username from here,

03:42.900 --> 03:45.180
whatever we made a note or we can go here

03:45.180 --> 03:47.827
and then copy the username from here also if you want, okay?

03:47.827 --> 03:49.980
So, I'm going to copy this

03:49.980 --> 03:54.980
and go back to our notification-microservice deployment here

03:56.430 --> 03:59.344
and I'm going to paste that, right?

03:59.344 --> 04:00.840
So that's the thing.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.340
And the mail server password,

04:02.340 --> 04:04.830
I'm going to remove this first, right?

04:04.830 --> 04:08.070
And I'm going to get it from here, right?

04:08.070 --> 04:10.920
Copy and then paste.

04:10.920 --> 04:14.130
And username, you know that it is stacksimplify@gmail.com

04:14.130 --> 04:16.950
The from address from which the email is getting initiated

04:16.950 --> 04:19.050
means like it looks like whenever you reach the email,

04:19.050 --> 04:21.193
the from address should be this one, okay?

04:21.193 --> 04:25.080
And mail server host, you can see SMTP service.

04:25.080 --> 04:28.230
So, let's go ahead and then see what is this SMTP service.

04:28.230 --> 04:29.730
Okay, so you can see here,

04:29.730 --> 04:32.160
notification-microservice SMTP,

04:32.160 --> 04:34.410
external name service, okay?

04:34.410 --> 04:37.140
So API version, kind and metadata, and then spec.

04:37.140 --> 04:37.973
All these are same,

04:37.973 --> 04:40.500
same as MySQL external name service, okay?

04:40.500 --> 04:43.110
Only thing the value under the external name

04:43.110 --> 04:45.540
is going to be whatever is present here, right?

04:45.540 --> 04:48.900
So in simple email service,

04:48.900 --> 04:51.480
in SMTP settings, right?

04:51.480 --> 04:53.610
So if you see here, this is the server name.

04:53.610 --> 04:57.930
So that is what will be your external name here, okay?

04:57.930 --> 05:01.380
So, that whenever the notification-microservice

05:01.380 --> 05:04.950
want to connect to SMTP server and send the email,

05:04.950 --> 05:08.190
the mail server host is going to be SMTP service

05:08.190 --> 05:10.740
which is nothing but the SMTP service

05:10.740 --> 05:12.900
external name service, SMTP service.

05:12.900 --> 05:17.400
This is the service which we are referencing here, okay?

05:17.400 --> 05:21.063
So, if I name it as SMTP service-abc,

05:22.440 --> 05:25.333
this value becomes SMTP service-abc.

05:25.333 --> 05:28.260
So, it's just only a naming convention, okay?

05:28.260 --> 05:30.870
So, I'm just going to remove this, but that's the thing.

05:30.870 --> 05:33.150
So, we created external name service here

05:33.150 --> 05:36.930
and then reference that in our environmental variable here.

05:36.930 --> 05:39.150
So, we have a completed discussing

05:39.150 --> 05:41.490
about this notification cluster IP service,

05:41.490 --> 05:43.950
notification-microservice deployment,

05:43.950 --> 05:46.440
and then notification related SMTP

05:46.440 --> 05:48.210
external name service, okay?

05:48.210 --> 05:49.860
So which means our step four,

05:49.860 --> 05:52.350
create notification, microservice-notification,

05:52.350 --> 05:54.840
microservice SMTP, external name service

05:54.840 --> 05:57.063
and then notification-microservice

05:57.063 --> 05:59.640
SMTP port services completed.

05:59.640 --> 06:00.870
So, in our next lecture,

06:00.870 --> 06:02.700
we'll focus on these other steps,

06:02.700 --> 06:04.454
which is YAML's node port service

06:04.454 --> 06:07.050
user management microservice deployment,

06:07.050 --> 06:11.760
MySQL external name service, and UMS Ingress service.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.590
So, I'll see you in the next lecture.

06:13.590 --> 06:14.700
Until then, bye-bye.

06:14.700 --> 06:15.533
Thank you.
