00:00.120 --> 00:00.990
Instructor: Welcome back.

00:00.990 --> 00:04.260
In previous lecture we have reviewed all the

00:04.260 --> 00:07.590
Kubernetes manifest related to notification

00:07.590 --> 00:10.230
cluster IP service, notification related

00:10.230 --> 00:11.610
external name service,

00:11.610 --> 00:15.840
and then notification microservice deployment manifest.

00:15.840 --> 00:18.030
So now we are going to look into

00:18.030 --> 00:21.867
user management microservice which is UMS note port service,

00:21.867 --> 00:25.680
UMS deployment, UMS my skill, external name service

00:25.680 --> 00:28.680
and then UMS ingress service.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.500
So let's go ahead and then review them now.

00:31.500 --> 00:36.300
So if you go to our GitHub repo, so the step seven here

00:36.300 --> 00:39.780
whatever it outlines is like update user management

00:39.780 --> 00:44.430
microservice deployment, manifest with notification service

00:44.430 --> 00:46.560
and we on mental variables.

00:46.560 --> 00:50.190
So if you see in this architecture diagram, so UMS service

00:50.190 --> 00:52.680
need to call them notification service.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.030
So how it is going to call

00:54.030 --> 00:56.970
it'll call the notification cluster IP service

00:56.970 --> 00:59.550
and then cluster IP service will call it soon

00:59.550 --> 01:01.890
notification respect to port, right?

01:01.890 --> 01:03.570
So now let's go back

01:03.570 --> 01:06.030
and then review that in our visual studio code.

01:06.030 --> 01:08.160
So user management microservice.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.830
So if you see its environmental variables, this is

01:10.830 --> 01:13.680
the same user management microservice deployment template

01:13.680 --> 01:17.340
whatever we have been using from EBS block store

01:17.340 --> 01:20.490
and then RDS databases or network load balances

01:20.490 --> 01:22.980
application ,load balancers, Fargate, everywhere.

01:22.980 --> 01:26.010
Okay? So that's the reason we are not going in detail.

01:26.010 --> 01:29.550
What is kind and then what is spec

01:29.550 --> 01:31.710
what is selector, what is spot template here?

01:31.710 --> 01:33.630
Okay, so we are directly getting

01:33.630 --> 01:35.550
into the environmental variables

01:35.550 --> 01:37.800
and in environmental variables.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.990
So these are the standard ones which are related

01:39.990 --> 01:43.800
to RDS database, which we have discussed in our RDS section.

01:43.800 --> 01:47.160
Only differences here, we really didn't put our secret

01:47.160 --> 01:48.690
in a separate AML manifest.

01:48.690 --> 01:50.640
Okay? So this is one Kubernetes subject

01:50.640 --> 01:53.310
and with the three hyphens we have separated

01:53.310 --> 01:56.040
and then added one more secrets manifest here directly.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.383
Instead of having them in two separate files,

01:59.340 --> 02:02.130
both deployment and then it's own secrets

02:02.130 --> 02:04.530
we have put it in the same file. That's all.

02:04.530 --> 02:08.520
Okay, so now in addition to those environmental variables

02:08.520 --> 02:11.460
we are going to add two more environmental variables

02:11.460 --> 02:13.650
which is notification service host

02:13.650 --> 02:15.810
and then notification service port.

02:15.810 --> 02:17.910
And notification service port we know that

02:17.910 --> 02:19.260
it is going to be 8096.

02:20.126 --> 02:20.959
That is good.

02:20.959 --> 02:23.700
Okay? So for notification service it is a 8096

02:23.700 --> 02:26.400
and user management it is 8095

02:26.400 --> 02:29.250
and the notification service host value is going to

02:29.250 --> 02:31.920
be a notification cluster IP service.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.860
So you can go to this notification cluster IP service

02:34.860 --> 02:36.930
and get this name from metadata

02:36.930 --> 02:40.260
and then you can directly update it here.

02:40.260 --> 02:44.040
So now you have completed the adaptation means

02:44.040 --> 02:46.050
like we already have it updated here.

02:46.050 --> 02:47.580
So we just discussed about that.

02:47.580 --> 02:48.840
Okay, So now you know

02:48.840 --> 02:51.690
that user management will have a note port service here

02:51.690 --> 02:54.780
because that using the note port service only

02:54.780 --> 02:56.760
we are going to integrate it

02:56.760 --> 02:58.800
with the ALB ingress controller.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.510
So which we discussed in our

03:00.510 --> 03:02.490
ingress controller section also.

03:02.490 --> 03:04.650
So this is the note port service standard template

03:04.650 --> 03:06.000
which is coming from previous thing.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.500
Only thing is health check path is going

03:07.500 --> 03:10.380
to be the same thing. Whatever we have earlier also.

03:10.380 --> 03:11.940
No changes to our note port service

03:11.940 --> 03:13.680
from our user management note port service

03:13.680 --> 03:15.990
from our previous templates.

03:15.990 --> 03:18.450
Okay, but now let's come back

03:18.450 --> 03:21.330
to our ingress as a cylinder ingress service.

03:21.330 --> 03:25.980
Okay? The name is going to be EKS microservices demo.

03:25.980 --> 03:29.670
This I have changed it. So, and the label.

03:29.670 --> 03:32.190
So you can put the label as the same.

03:32.190 --> 03:36.550
Okay? So you can map it to user management rest stop.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.330
Okay? So okay fine.

03:39.330 --> 03:43.290
So EKS microservices demo and if you see it here

03:43.290 --> 03:46.470
so slash star SSL redirect is already there from beginning

03:46.470 --> 03:47.790
which we have seen.

03:47.790 --> 03:50.940
And in this, if you want to change

03:50.940 --> 03:53.310
what are the things you need to change

03:53.310 --> 03:55.350
if you are doing it right?

03:55.350 --> 03:57.900
So primarily you need to change your SSL certificate

03:57.900 --> 03:58.733
path here, right?

03:58.733 --> 04:01.530
Means like your SSL certificate information

04:01.530 --> 04:03.720
with your account ID and then all these things

04:03.720 --> 04:06.660
you need to put in this template to

04:06.660 --> 04:10.110
make it work for you and rest all.

04:10.110 --> 04:12.300
And then you need to update your own domain.

04:12.300 --> 04:15.450
So this is services.Q1cloud.com.

04:15.450 --> 04:19.230
So in your case it is going to be something else, right?

04:19.230 --> 04:22.770
See here this ALB ingress manifest also only two changes

04:22.770 --> 04:24.900
as we discuss it which is your certificate

04:24.900 --> 04:26.040
you need to update

04:26.040 --> 04:28.470
and then your domain name you need to update.

04:28.470 --> 04:31.050
And one thing you need to make a note of is

04:31.050 --> 04:33.960
this one is going to send the traffic to user management

04:33.960 --> 04:37.080
rest stop note port service, which is nothing but our

04:37.080 --> 04:39.510
this respect you note port service.

04:39.510 --> 04:42.360
Which eventually will catch up the pod using this selector

04:42.360 --> 04:44.940
and then send that traffic to user management

04:44.940 --> 04:46.950
microservice container here.

04:46.950 --> 04:48.450
Okay? So that's about it.

04:48.450 --> 04:51.060
So this is about the manifest discussion

04:51.060 --> 04:56.060
from 01 to 07 in this two lectures.

04:56.790 --> 04:59.220
Okay? So we have discussed everything

04:59.220 --> 05:01.110
in our next lecture we'll go ahead

05:01.110 --> 05:03.540
and then deploy and then test everything.

05:03.540 --> 05:05.190
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

05:05.190 --> 05:06.873
Until then, bye bye. Thank you.
