00:00.450 --> 00:01.283
Instructor: Welcome back.

00:01.283 --> 00:03.180
In this lecture we are going to delete

00:03.180 --> 00:06.540
and recreate objects using Kubectl apply.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.540
So earlier you used to use Kubectl delete

00:09.540 --> 00:13.440
and then you used to provide the resource name to delete it.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.080
But here, whatever the resource you have created

00:16.080 --> 00:17.580
or the object you have created,

00:17.580 --> 00:20.130
you'll be able to directly delete using...

00:20.130 --> 00:22.590
By referencing those YAML files. Okay?

00:22.590 --> 00:24.530
So let's see that now. Okay?

00:24.530 --> 00:27.720
So Kubectl, get all will provide lots of stuff,

00:27.720 --> 00:29.553
whatever we have created so far.

00:30.990 --> 00:33.510
So now we will say that.

00:33.510 --> 00:35.070
So we have four files here.

00:35.070 --> 00:38.200
So Kubectl delete -F01

00:40.260 --> 00:41.093
and 02,

00:43.307 --> 00:45.573
and 03,

00:46.920 --> 00:49.032
and one more time.

00:49.032 --> 00:51.570
0-F and then 04.

00:51.570 --> 00:53.790
So all the things related to backend

00:53.790 --> 00:55.830
and front end should go away now.

00:55.830 --> 00:56.663
Okay.

00:56.663 --> 00:58.710
So all got deleted you can see, right?

00:58.710 --> 01:00.150
So if you say get all,

01:00.150 --> 01:01.800
so anything related to our backend

01:01.800 --> 01:04.620
and front end should not be shown now.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.903
So if you see only the part backend,

01:07.770 --> 01:09.120
press tab, getting terminated,

01:09.120 --> 01:10.560
you can see these things. Okay?

01:10.560 --> 01:11.970
So nothing related to backend

01:11.970 --> 01:16.738
and front end will be seen after these gets terminated.

01:16.738 --> 01:18.090
Nothing, right?

01:18.090 --> 01:21.390
So now you can see deployments only my app redeployment.

01:21.390 --> 01:22.590
So nothing in the services.

01:22.590 --> 01:25.920
Also there is nothing related to front end and the backend.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.240
So that's about it.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.850
In the same way if you want to create it again,

01:29.850 --> 01:33.153
you can create it directly using apply-

01:34.020 --> 01:35.160
and then those values.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.770
But one more interesting thing here is,

01:37.770 --> 01:42.540
so, if you have these four files and then creating apply

01:42.540 --> 01:45.693
and then -F01 and then -F02.

01:47.100 --> 01:48.630
Again, it's a long command, right?

01:48.630 --> 01:49.770
So what you can do is,

01:49.770 --> 01:51.900
come out of your cube manifest,

01:51.900 --> 01:55.007
and just I will,

01:56.557 --> 01:59.250
let me go here and I don't have anything here,

01:59.250 --> 02:03.120
so I'll say MV this file, right?

02:03.120 --> 02:05.040
00, this is not a valid file.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.830
This is just only a definition for us, right?

02:07.830 --> 02:10.890
Paste, and then paste,

02:10.890 --> 02:15.540
and then I'll save this, back up. Okay?

02:15.540 --> 02:17.340
So for our testing here, okay?

02:17.340 --> 02:19.830
So now we have only four YAML files here.

02:19.830 --> 02:22.650
One, two, three, and then four.

02:22.650 --> 02:24.930
So let me come out of cube manifest.

02:24.930 --> 02:29.580
And then I'll say Kubectl apply -F

02:29.580 --> 02:31.980
and then cube manifest entire folder.

02:31.980 --> 02:35.160
So whatever the YAML files present in that folder,

02:35.160 --> 02:36.390
directly present, okay?

02:36.390 --> 02:38.490
Not under the (inaudible) folders

02:38.490 --> 02:40.920
but directly present under that folder,

02:40.920 --> 02:43.833
it is going to get created. Okay?

02:44.798 --> 02:47.820
So if I say Kubectl get all,

02:47.820 --> 02:51.510
again we'll be able to see the deployments and services

02:51.510 --> 02:53.880
whatever related to front end, right?

02:53.880 --> 02:56.701
Front end and backend related parts are getting created.

02:56.701 --> 03:00.390
And its services, also front end ingenix

03:00.390 --> 03:03.660
and then my backend service all got created.

03:03.660 --> 03:06.720
So like that we'll be able to create and then delete.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.890
In the same way,

03:07.890 --> 03:09.630
if you want to again delete all these things

03:09.630 --> 03:12.720
we really don't need to give that big command here. Okay?

03:12.720 --> 03:17.720
So Kubectl, delete -F and cube manifest

03:18.360 --> 03:21.941
and then it is going to delete everything.

03:21.941 --> 03:23.550
Good. Okay?

03:23.550 --> 03:27.750
So now if you see get all, nothing should be there.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.163
So these are some of the things

03:29.163 --> 03:31.920
which we can effectively use for our...

03:31.920 --> 03:33.660
See this is getting terminated.

03:33.660 --> 03:37.200
No other services related to front end or backend. Good.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.610
So now the next thing is,

03:38.610 --> 03:40.140
go back to cube manifest

03:40.140 --> 03:44.943
and then change our file back, okay?

03:48.360 --> 03:51.630
To the same value, so that whenever you're doing the course

03:51.630 --> 03:55.200
it doesn't give a different show there. Okay?

03:55.200 --> 03:56.793
So now this is completed.

03:58.380 --> 03:59.213
Good.

03:59.213 --> 04:00.660
So, in our next lecture

04:00.660 --> 04:02.880
we'll go- go ahead with another topic.

04:02.880 --> 04:04.590
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

04:04.590 --> 04:05.910
Until then, bye bye.

04:05.910 --> 04:06.743
Thank you.
