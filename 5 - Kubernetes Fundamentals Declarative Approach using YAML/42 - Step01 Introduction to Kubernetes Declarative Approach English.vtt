00:00.120 --> 00:00.953
-: Welcome back.

00:00.953 --> 00:01.800
So far,

00:01.800 --> 00:05.400
we have completed from Kubernetes Fundamentals Perspective.

00:05.400 --> 00:08.310
Using Imperative Way we have created a port.

00:08.310 --> 00:11.700
And for ReplicaSet we really don't have a imperative command

00:11.700 --> 00:13.170
using kubectl.

00:13.170 --> 00:15.960
So we use the yaml format to create it.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.218
And the deployment and service

00:17.218 --> 00:19.530
also using imperative way.

00:19.530 --> 00:21.390
We have created it.

00:21.390 --> 00:25.470
So now using yaml and then kubectl

00:25.470 --> 00:29.820
we are going to create pods, ReplicaSets, deployments

00:29.820 --> 00:34.820
and then services in a declarative manner using yaml.

00:35.280 --> 00:38.220
So let's go ahead and then do that now.

00:38.220 --> 00:40.110
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

00:40.110 --> 00:41.460
Until then, bye bye.

00:41.460 --> 00:42.293
Thank you.
