00:00.180 --> 00:01.110
-: Welcome back.

00:01.110 --> 00:03.150
In this lecture we are going to understand

00:03.150 --> 00:05.823
about deployments with YAML.

00:05.823 --> 00:08.250
So 09 deployments with YAML.

00:08.250 --> 00:10.230
So as we discussed earlier,

00:10.230 --> 00:13.140
so deployments are nothing, but, again,

00:13.140 --> 00:17.010
deployment is nothing but a super set of replica set.

00:17.010 --> 00:20.640
So we have created a replica set in our previous lecture.

00:20.640 --> 00:23.130
So we are going to copy all those templates

00:23.130 --> 00:25.320
and then change its kind to deployment

00:25.320 --> 00:28.140
and then container image to 3.0.0

00:28.140 --> 00:31.320
for a difference and then change the North port service

00:31.320 --> 00:34.440
to 31233 for accessing it on the browser.

00:34.440 --> 00:37.500
Earlier, so the part is 31231

00:37.500 --> 00:39.810
and replica set is 31232.

00:39.810 --> 00:41.040
You can see it here.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.990
Now we'll use 31233 for

00:45.960 --> 00:46.830
deployments

00:46.830 --> 00:50.280
and then change all the names to deployment in the sense

00:50.280 --> 00:54.120
like the file names or whatever we see wherever, right?

00:54.120 --> 00:56.670
Instead of replica set change it to deployment

00:56.670 --> 00:58.590
and also change the labels

00:58.590 --> 01:01.230
and select s two, Mya app three, okay.

01:01.230 --> 01:02.643
And then clear the deployment

01:02.643 --> 01:04.843
note port service and then list and test it.

01:05.700 --> 01:08.100
So before going there, let's crosscheck our

01:08.100 --> 01:09.960
APA reference document.

01:09.960 --> 01:13.380
And for deployment also it is app slash v1.

01:13.380 --> 01:16.650
So just if you change the kind from replica set

01:16.650 --> 01:19.590
to deployment, mostly our things should work.

01:19.590 --> 01:22.590
Okay? So let's go to our visual studio court.

01:22.590 --> 01:23.783
And this is the replica sets with

01:23.783 --> 01:26.040
the AML Kube manifest folder.

01:26.040 --> 01:30.242
So let me copy it and then go to 09 deployment

01:30.242 --> 01:32.580
and then paste it, right?

01:32.580 --> 01:35.910
And I'll change the, rename the file to

01:35.910 --> 01:37.653
deployment here, okay?

01:37.653 --> 01:39.591
Instead of replica set,

01:39.591 --> 01:44.591
so that we have it as a deployment reference.

01:44.970 --> 01:47.850
Okay? And for north port service, whatever we are

01:47.850 --> 01:50.980
going to create also I'm going to change it to

01:52.980 --> 01:55.530
deployment. Good.

01:55.530 --> 01:57.120
So now our base setup is done.

01:57.120 --> 02:00.120
So let's go to zero to deployment definition.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.580
And the first thing is APA version,

02:02.580 --> 02:05.130
it matched with our this one, okay?

02:05.130 --> 02:07.200
So we really don't need to change anything here.

02:07.200 --> 02:11.580
Okay? So only thing is kind is going to be deployment

02:11.580 --> 02:15.860
and the name is going to be my app three deployment.

02:17.490 --> 02:19.740
Okay? So now replicas are good

02:19.740 --> 02:21.750
selector is good, and the app -

02:21.750 --> 02:23.700
which is nothing but the selector match labels -

02:23.700 --> 02:25.500
we said that we will change from

02:25.500 --> 02:27.870
my app two to my app three.

02:27.870 --> 02:29.670
So let's change it, okay?

02:29.670 --> 02:32.130
So, and the template, my app three part

02:32.130 --> 02:33.180
I can say this one,

02:33.180 --> 02:35.520
name of the part and the labels,

02:35.520 --> 02:37.020
I can say my app three.

02:37.020 --> 02:39.420
So the most important thing is this one,

02:39.420 --> 02:42.870
the label and the match label, both should match.

02:42.870 --> 02:45.720
And the container name, I can give it as my app three.

02:45.720 --> 02:47.070
And finally we also said

02:47.070 --> 02:49.770
that we'll change the image version.

02:49.770 --> 02:53.010
Okay? So for our difference to see on our browser.

02:53.010 --> 02:55.530
So I'll say three dot zero dot zero.

02:55.530 --> 02:59.010
So this completes the deployment spec update.

02:59.010 --> 03:01.980
So we really didn't add any new tags or anything.

03:01.980 --> 03:05.674
So this is-- like any replica set is a subset of deployment.

03:05.674 --> 03:09.090
So all these things should work as is without anything.

03:09.090 --> 03:12.690
So for deployments we can keep adding more and more stuff,

03:12.690 --> 03:15.150
based on like how the deployment should happen.

03:15.150 --> 03:19.290
And then like it should be in a rolling update fashion,

03:19.290 --> 03:21.090
or it should be in a recreate fashion,

03:21.090 --> 03:24.390
so update strategies with the recreate or rolling updates.

03:24.390 --> 03:27.120
So all those super set options you can keep adding

03:27.120 --> 03:28.890
to your deployment if you want to,

03:28.890 --> 03:31.500
but the base is replica set and then deployment,

03:31.500 --> 03:33.990
more or less, it is going to be the same thing.

03:33.990 --> 03:36.840
Okay, so now let's go to note port service, right?

03:36.840 --> 03:39.570
So this is good and no changes required inside that.

03:39.570 --> 03:41.610
So let's go to note port service

03:41.610 --> 03:46.380
and this is going to be deployment, not port service.

03:46.380 --> 03:50.220
And the selector is going to be my app three, right?

03:50.220 --> 03:54.540
And the note port I'm going to change is 31233.

03:54.540 --> 03:57.930
Okay. So now we have quickly completed creating

03:57.930 --> 04:00.840
the deployment definition and deployment note port service.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.480
So let's go ahead and then create them now.

04:03.480 --> 04:07.530
Okay, so we'll go to 09 deployments

04:07.530 --> 04:09.420
and we'll go to Kube manifest

04:09.420 --> 04:14.100
and I'll say Kube CTL

04:14.100 --> 04:18.540
apply F and F 02 deployment definition.

04:18.540 --> 04:21.300
And if you want to also at the same time

04:21.300 --> 04:22.650
create one more.

04:22.650 --> 04:25.650
So that is nothing but zero three, you can do this way.

04:25.650 --> 04:28.980
Okay? So now two files you have provided

04:28.980 --> 04:30.390
for Kube CTL to create.

04:30.390 --> 04:33.240
So it created my app three deployment

04:33.240 --> 04:35.070
and then deployment note port service.

04:35.070 --> 04:38.460
So I'll say Kube CTL, get deploy,

04:38.460 --> 04:40.530
which is the LES, and it's up and running.

04:40.530 --> 04:43.290
So I'll say Kube CTL get ports.

04:43.290 --> 04:46.140
So I should have three more ports related to my deployment

04:46.140 --> 04:47.490
Got creator.

04:47.490 --> 04:50.310
I should have two replica sets, right,

04:50.310 --> 04:52.530
one for the replica set, whatever we created

04:52.530 --> 04:54.980
and one which a deployment created.

04:54.980 --> 04:58.530
And I'll also see the SVC, okay?

04:58.530 --> 05:00.990
And it has the 31233

05:00.990 --> 05:03.390
which is deployment, note port service.

05:03.390 --> 05:07.740
So, and we'll get the nodes hyphen O wide,

05:07.740 --> 05:09.420
and we'll get the node IP.

05:09.420 --> 05:10.950
And with the

05:10.950 --> 05:15.390
31233, we are going to access it in browser.

05:15.390 --> 05:19.837
Okay? So next one http colon slash slash

05:19.837 --> 05:22.413
31233, okay.

05:23.730 --> 05:25.860
And we see the V3 version of application.

05:25.860 --> 05:28.320
So with ports V1 application,

05:28.320 --> 05:30.340
it's up and running, with

05:32.490 --> 05:35.070
replica sets, V2 application, up and running.

05:35.070 --> 05:38.250
And with ports we have V3 application.

05:38.250 --> 05:41.340
So now we have successfully created the ports,

05:41.340 --> 05:43.410
ports with the-- using the deployment.

05:43.410 --> 05:47.520
And then we have tested it using note port service.

05:47.520 --> 05:50.940
So in our next lecture, we'll focus on services

05:50.940 --> 05:54.450
and there, as we already see note port service effectively,

05:54.450 --> 05:56.340
there we'll see cluster IP service

05:56.340 --> 05:58.950
and also we'll create a frontend and backend application

05:58.950 --> 06:01.500
in services and then understand it in detail

06:01.500 --> 06:02.790
and then test it.

06:02.790 --> 06:04.530
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

06:04.530 --> 06:05.700
Until then, bye bye.

06:05.700 --> 06:06.533
Thank you.
