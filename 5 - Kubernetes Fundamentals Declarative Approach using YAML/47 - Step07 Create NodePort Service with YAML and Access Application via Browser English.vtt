00:00.300 --> 00:01.133
-: Welcome back.

00:01.133 --> 00:02.910
In this lecture we are going to

00:02.910 --> 00:05.640
create a NodePort service for our ReplicaSet

00:05.640 --> 00:06.960
and then test it, okay?

00:06.960 --> 00:10.650
So let's go back to our Visual Studio Core

00:10.650 --> 00:13.830
and go to our Kube-based definition

00:13.830 --> 00:16.920
and then copy it in our ReplicaSet NodePort service.

00:16.920 --> 00:20.100
As we know for our type of service we are going to create

00:20.100 --> 00:22.680
is Service and its version is V1

00:22.680 --> 00:25.821
and the name of this service is

00:25.821 --> 00:26.654
ReplicaSet

00:27.896 --> 00:30.030
NodePort service.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.080
And for any service,

00:31.080 --> 00:33.150
the following three are the high level things,

00:33.150 --> 00:34.080
which is nothing but

00:34.080 --> 00:35.430
Type,

00:35.430 --> 00:36.780
Selector,

00:36.780 --> 00:37.800
and

00:37.800 --> 00:39.270
Ports, right?

00:39.270 --> 00:41.580
So now let's start with the type.

00:41.580 --> 00:43.590
The NodePort service we are going to create,

00:43.590 --> 00:45.540
so let's mark it as NodePort.

00:45.540 --> 00:48.870
And let's complete Ports before going to Selector, okay?

00:48.870 --> 00:53.670
So now Ports. We are going to have a Ports now.

00:53.670 --> 00:55.590
So it is list of ports.

00:55.590 --> 00:56.423
So

00:58.380 --> 01:00.240
now it is going to be

01:00.240 --> 01:01.950
name is http.

01:01.950 --> 01:06.480
And my port name, so this is the port name,

01:06.480 --> 01:09.690
and it is going to be eight, 80.

01:09.690 --> 01:12.270
And we are going to define our targetPort,

01:12.270 --> 01:14.580
which is our ContainerPort is 80.

01:14.580 --> 01:17.820
And NodePort, which is nothing but on the worker node

01:17.820 --> 01:19.200
what port you want to use.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.460
You can define it.

01:20.460 --> 01:22.800
So I am going to say 31232.

01:22.800 --> 01:26.340
For our pod NodePort service we use 31231.

01:26.340 --> 01:27.663
Here we are using 31232.

01:28.650 --> 01:30.720
So now the selector, again, as usual,

01:30.720 --> 01:32.820
go to your ReplicaSet definition

01:32.820 --> 01:35.700
and then this is the label you have in your PodTemplate.

01:35.700 --> 01:37.110
So let's get that.

01:37.110 --> 01:39.600
And then to these pods, it need to load balance, right?

01:39.600 --> 01:41.430
You are respect to service,

01:41.430 --> 01:43.830
need to load balance or send the traffic

01:43.830 --> 01:46.800
to those respective pods, okay?

01:46.800 --> 01:48.810
So then you need to identify the pods

01:48.810 --> 01:50.400
based on a selector, okay?

01:50.400 --> 01:52.410
So that is nothing but label selector.

01:52.410 --> 01:55.650
So it is going to be myapp2, okay?

01:55.650 --> 01:59.163
So now your NodePort ReplicaSet service is created.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.940
So let's go ahead and then create that now.

02:02.940 --> 02:04.560
Kubectl

02:04.560 --> 02:06.000
Apply

02:06.000 --> 02:07.500
03, right?

02:07.500 --> 02:09.783
And if any error it is going to throw here,

02:11.730 --> 02:13.855
any definition error or something, but ideally no error.

02:13.855 --> 02:14.688
So get svc.

02:14.688 --> 02:15.521
It looks good.

02:15.521 --> 02:18.059
So three one, with 31232 our ReplicaSet NodePort set,

02:18.059 --> 02:21.570
NodePort service got created.

02:21.570 --> 02:23.550
So we can go ahead and then say

02:23.550 --> 02:25.360
get nodes -o wide

02:26.277 --> 02:30.060
and get the public IP and then access it with 31232.

02:30.060 --> 02:33.288
So if you remember here, so we are accessing 31231,

02:33.288 --> 02:36.313
with the V1 application with the plane port

02:36.313 --> 02:41.313
and with the ReplicaSet we are going to say 31232, okay?

02:42.823 --> 02:46.200
And we should have a V2 version of application.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.690
So with the plane pod we got V1

02:48.690 --> 02:52.380
and then with ReplicaSet we got V2, okay?

02:52.380 --> 02:55.350
So this completes the creation

02:55.350 --> 02:59.190
of ReplicaSet definition using YAML.

02:59.190 --> 03:02.340
So in our next lecture, we'll focus on deployment.

03:02.340 --> 03:04.350
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.303
Until then, bye bye.

03:05.303 --> 03:06.453
Thank you.
