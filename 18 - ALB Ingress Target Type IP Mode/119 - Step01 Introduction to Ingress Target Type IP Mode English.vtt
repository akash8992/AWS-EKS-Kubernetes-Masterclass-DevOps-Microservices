00:00.360 --> 00:01.470
-: Welcome back.

00:01.470 --> 00:03.780
In this section we are going to learn about

00:03.780 --> 00:08.780
Kubernetes Ingress concept name target-type: ip.

00:08.940 --> 00:12.270
So let's understand what is ALB Ingress

00:12.270 --> 00:15.270
Kubernetes target-type annotation first.

00:15.270 --> 00:18.120
So this target-type annotation specifies

00:18.120 --> 00:20.790
how to route traffic to your ports,

00:20.790 --> 00:23.040
which is nothing but your Kubernetes ports

00:23.040 --> 00:25.560
from your Application Load Balancer.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.900
And we have two ways to do that

00:27.900 --> 00:30.240
in our ALB Ingress target types.

00:30.240 --> 00:34.470
One is instance mode and another one is IP mode.

00:34.470 --> 00:36.810
Let's understand the instance mode first,

00:36.810 --> 00:39.510
and then we'll move to the IP mode.

00:39.510 --> 00:41.670
So instance mode will route traffic

00:41.670 --> 00:45.510
to all EC2 instances within the cluster

00:45.510 --> 00:48.930
on the nodeport open for your service.

00:48.930 --> 00:52.680
Which means, if you remember our previous examples also,

00:52.680 --> 00:55.800
we have created an app1, app2, app3 deployment

00:55.800 --> 00:59.790
and we also created an app1, app2, app3 nodeport service.

00:59.790 --> 01:02.550
So the request coming to your Application Load Balancer

01:02.550 --> 01:05.484
will go to that Kubernetes NodePort service.

01:05.484 --> 01:07.950
And from that Kubernetes NodePort service

01:07.950 --> 01:10.830
it is going to your application port.

01:10.830 --> 01:13.230
And this Kubernetes NodePort service will have

01:13.230 --> 01:18.230
your worker node IP:port from that respective node.

01:18.330 --> 01:21.917
And this service must be of type nodeport

01:21.917 --> 01:25.770
or loadbalancer to use the instance mode.

01:25.770 --> 01:26.603
That's clear.

01:26.603 --> 01:28.380
We have implemented the NodePort service

01:28.380 --> 01:30.450
for our previous examples.

01:30.450 --> 01:34.080
And the default target-type is instance mode

01:34.080 --> 01:36.150
in our Ingress resources.

01:36.150 --> 01:37.860
Which means we don't need to

01:37.860 --> 01:40.470
define this annotation in Ingress.

01:40.470 --> 01:43.680
By default, it takes instance mode.

01:43.680 --> 01:46.020
So if you see our Ingress templates defined

01:46.020 --> 01:48.712
previous to this demo, nowhere we have defined

01:48.712 --> 01:52.560
alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type instance.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.570
So why we don't need to define that?

01:54.570 --> 01:57.300
Because the default target-type is instance mode

01:57.300 --> 01:59.400
and we don't need to define this.

01:59.400 --> 02:03.900
Now let's understand what is this target-type IP mode.

02:03.900 --> 02:06.900
IP mode will route traffic directly to the pod

02:06.900 --> 02:09.540
which means when the request comes from the internet

02:09.540 --> 02:11.790
to your Application Load Balancer,

02:11.790 --> 02:13.860
from there that request will directly go

02:13.860 --> 02:15.780
to your Kubernetes pod.

02:15.780 --> 02:18.390
So there is no middle man like Kubernetes

02:18.390 --> 02:20.730
NodePort service involved here,

02:20.730 --> 02:24.028
and IP mode is required for sticky sessions

02:24.028 --> 02:27.210
to work with Application Load Balancer.

02:27.210 --> 02:30.960
So that is the core reason for implementing the IP mode

02:30.960 --> 02:34.140
when you are using the EC2 worker nodes.

02:34.140 --> 02:36.685
But when you are using the Fargate,

02:36.685 --> 02:39.990
definitely you only need to use IP mode.

02:39.990 --> 02:41.880
And when we are implementing our learning,

02:41.880 --> 02:43.290
the Fargate concepts,

02:43.290 --> 02:45.750
we'll also know more about IP mode there.

02:45.750 --> 02:47.730
And also they're the only option for you

02:47.730 --> 02:51.060
whenever you want to use AWS Fargate server list.

02:51.060 --> 02:54.600
At that point in time you need to use IP mode only

02:54.600 --> 02:57.840
and need to define the annotation explicitly

02:57.840 --> 03:02.100
as target-type: ip.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.230
This completes the introductory part

03:04.230 --> 03:06.690
of target-type: ip.

03:06.690 --> 03:09.150
So in our next lecture we are going to practically

03:09.150 --> 03:12.720
implement this concept and understand about it.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.280
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

03:14.280 --> 03:15.450
Until then, bye bye.

03:15.450 --> 03:16.283
Thank you.
