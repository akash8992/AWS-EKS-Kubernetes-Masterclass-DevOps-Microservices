00:00.480 --> 00:01.530
-: Welcome back.

00:01.530 --> 00:04.740
In this section we are going to implement another

00:04.740 --> 00:09.150
important Ingress concept called 'Name-based Virtual Host'

00:09.150 --> 00:11.670
our Host header based Routing.

00:11.670 --> 00:14.070
And we are going to implement this concept

00:14.070 --> 00:17.340
on AWS Application Load Balancer.

00:17.340 --> 00:21.720
So let's understand the network design further, same thing.

00:21.720 --> 00:25.140
As usual, we are going to use our three applications,

00:25.140 --> 00:27.060
AppOne, AppTwo and AppThree.

00:27.060 --> 00:29.820
So there three Kubernetes deployments

00:29.820 --> 00:32.070
and NodePort services are going to be

00:32.070 --> 00:35.580
as is and in the Ingress is the core thing.

00:35.580 --> 00:38.370
Inside Ingress we are going to make the changes

00:38.370 --> 00:42.090
forever, rules. So we are going to define rules

00:42.090 --> 00:44.760
with Host header based routing.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.530
So we are going to define two rules.

00:46.530 --> 00:49.110
One is AppOne.stacksimplify.com

00:49.110 --> 00:53.460
which means when host equal to AppOnestacksimplify.com.

00:53.460 --> 00:56.580
Route the request to 'AppOne NodePort service'.

00:56.580 --> 00:59.250
From there, it'll go to that respective pod.

00:59.250 --> 01:02.790
And when the host equal to AppTwo.stacksimplify.com

01:02.790 --> 01:06.480
go to 'AppTwo NodePort service'.

01:06.480 --> 01:09.930
And from there it will go to 'Equivalent AppTwo port'.

01:09.930 --> 01:13.500
And for default to '.stacksimplifi.com'.

01:13.500 --> 01:14.820
And this is not a rule.

01:14.820 --> 01:17.130
So this is directly will define this related

01:17.130 --> 01:21.302
to default backend with external DNS related annotation

01:21.302 --> 01:25.620
and anything you access with default '.stacksimplify.com'.

01:25.620 --> 01:28.890
So it will go to 'AppThree NodePort service'

01:28.890 --> 01:30.720
and from there it will go to

01:30.720 --> 01:33.390
AppThree deployment related port.

01:33.390 --> 01:37.440
So now, next thing here is whenever you deploy

01:37.440 --> 01:39.540
this Ingress resource, right?

01:39.540 --> 01:41.820
So when you define these host rules

01:41.820 --> 01:45.810
AppOne.stacksimplify.com AppTwo.stacksimplify.com

01:45.810 --> 01:49.710
and whenever you deploy these Ingress rules and already

01:49.710 --> 01:53.460
if you have the external DNS related ports running

01:53.460 --> 01:55.260
in your EKS cluster.

01:55.260 --> 02:00.030
So then it is going to DNS list those domain names

02:00.030 --> 02:03.120
whatever you have specified in host also.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.090
In addition to whatever you have specified

02:06.090 --> 02:09.660
in your external DNS related annotation.

02:09.660 --> 02:12.180
So which means in the host rules also you have

02:12.180 --> 02:14.323
specified AppOne.stickssimplify.com

02:14.323 --> 02:17.310
and AppTwo.stacksimplify.com.

02:17.310 --> 02:21.120
So these two also will get DNS listed in your Route 53

02:21.120 --> 02:26.120
using external DNS and whenever user accesses

02:26.437 --> 02:31.437
AppOne.stacksimplify.com/AppOne/index.html.

02:31.440 --> 02:36.150
So the request will come to our Ingress and then go

02:36.150 --> 02:39.480
to the AppOne NodePort service and that respective port.

02:39.480 --> 02:42.540
In same line whenever user accesses AppTwo.

02:42.540 --> 02:46.963
So it comes to AppTwo, AppTwo related rule

02:46.963 --> 02:49.230
Ingress load balancer.

02:49.230 --> 02:51.710
And from there it will go to AppTwo NodePort service

02:51.710 --> 02:55.440
and reach the AppTwo related engineer port.

02:55.440 --> 03:00.020
And whenever user accesses with default '.stacksimplify.com'

03:00.020 --> 03:03.480
So request will go to the default backend.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.810
So this is called the Host header based routing

03:06.810 --> 03:11.760
or Name-based Virtual Host routing in Ingress.

03:11.760 --> 03:16.140
And let's see the templates, how it is going to look for us.

03:16.140 --> 03:19.890
So these are the rules, whatever we have discussed so far.

03:19.890 --> 03:21.990
So earlier, the rules used to start

03:21.990 --> 03:25.601
with http and under http you used to have parts

03:25.601 --> 03:27.810
and you can define multiple parts.

03:27.810 --> 03:30.450
That is called Context Path based routing

03:30.450 --> 03:33.449
and for Host header based routing.

03:33.449 --> 03:35.700
So it will start with the host

03:35.700 --> 03:38.250
and you'll define your host whatever you want.

03:38.250 --> 03:42.420
Here we have defined AppOne01.stacksimplify.com.

03:42.420 --> 03:44.670
And under that with the root context

03:44.670 --> 03:48.210
whatever comes go to AppOne NGINX NodePort service.

03:48.210 --> 03:51.540
So request with AppOne01.stacksimplify.com

03:51.540 --> 03:54.960
will go to AppOne NodePort serve.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.121
And in same line for the request

03:57.121 --> 04:00.840
with AppTwo01.stacksimplify.com, right?

04:00.840 --> 04:04.110
It goes to AppTwo NGINX NodePort service.

04:04.110 --> 04:06.690
So these two are the rules we are going to have

04:06.690 --> 04:09.810
with this Name-based Virtual Host routing.

04:09.810 --> 04:11.350
And in addition to that

04:11.350 --> 04:15.090
for the default backend you are seeing here, right?

04:15.090 --> 04:17.649
So for the default backend we can directly

04:17.649 --> 04:22.530
use our external DNS related annotation wherein

04:22.530 --> 04:25.460
with the default 101.stacksimplify.com

04:25.460 --> 04:27.870
goes to our default backend

04:27.870 --> 04:30.870
which is AppThree NodePort service.

04:30.870 --> 04:33.900
So this completes the introductory part

04:33.900 --> 04:37.590
of Kubernetes Ingress Name-based Virtual Host routing

04:37.590 --> 04:39.000
or Host header routing.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.010
In our next lecture, we are going to go ahead

04:41.010 --> 04:43.950
and then practically implement this use case.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.510
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

04:45.510 --> 04:46.800
Until then, bye bye.

04:46.800 --> 04:47.633
Thank you.
