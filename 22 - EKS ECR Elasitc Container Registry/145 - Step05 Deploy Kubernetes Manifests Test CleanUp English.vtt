00:00.120 --> 00:03.570
-: Welcome back. In this lecture we are going to

00:03.570 --> 00:07.410
do the Kubernetes manifest deployments now.

00:07.410 --> 00:09.630
So let's go ahead and then deploy the stuff

00:09.630 --> 00:13.950
whatever is presenting zero two cube manifest folder, right?

00:13.950 --> 00:15.820
So please ensure that you are in

00:17.640 --> 00:22.640
10 ECL elastic container restrain EKS directory and clear.

00:23.010 --> 00:26.010
And I'm going to say Cube CTL apply hyphen F

00:26.010 --> 00:29.700
and then zero to cube manifest folder, right?

00:29.700 --> 00:34.700
So it's going to create our respect you deployment services

00:35.340 --> 00:36.570
and then ingress.

00:36.570 --> 00:39.840
So I'll say Cube CTL get paused, right?

00:39.840 --> 00:42.090
It is going to do in a default only.

00:42.090 --> 00:46.920
Okay, so my two cube ECR ports are running,

00:46.920 --> 00:49.200
right? So I'll say

00:49.200 --> 00:53.730
get SVC. So it should create a equivalent note port service.

00:53.730 --> 00:54.840
That's good.

00:54.840 --> 00:58.920
And then I'm also going to say get ingress, right?

00:58.920 --> 01:01.110
So ingress you are also keen.

01:01.110 --> 01:04.020
So we can go back to our browser

01:04.020 --> 01:09.020
and management console and we'll go to E two, right?

01:09.420 --> 01:12.060
So it should be getting provisioned right now.

01:12.060 --> 01:14.643
So let me go to load balances.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.660
And our load balancer is getting provision application

01:18.660 --> 01:20.130
and it can verify the tag,

01:20.130 --> 01:22.980
it should be easier ingress service.

01:22.980 --> 01:26.520
And in listeners we'll have 40, 80 with the redirect.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.100
And this one certificate associated

01:29.100 --> 01:32.190
and slash star should go to the respective target group.

01:32.190 --> 01:34.320
So let me open the target group

01:34.320 --> 01:37.980
and it has the path as index start SGML whatever we provided

01:37.980 --> 01:41.970
at the note port service level and in targets.

01:41.970 --> 01:43.710
So it's getting registered.

01:43.710 --> 01:46.410
Okay? So let's wait for a while to get the things

01:46.410 --> 01:49.440
registered. So I'll go to target groups

01:49.440 --> 01:52.263
and then refresh one more time and then see.

01:53.220 --> 01:55.050
So it'll take a two to three minutes.

01:55.050 --> 01:56.340
So let's wait for that.

01:56.340 --> 01:59.850
In meantime we can go to route 53

01:59.850 --> 02:03.090
and verify our DNS here, right?

02:03.090 --> 02:06.690
So we should be ECR demo dot q1 cloud.com.

02:06.690 --> 02:11.220
So if you go here, so q1 cloud.com and inside

02:11.220 --> 02:16.220
that you should find ECR demo dot q1 cloud.com.

02:16.230 --> 02:17.940
So this is also good.

02:17.940 --> 02:22.940
So let's go back, go back and go back to target groups.

02:23.970 --> 02:27.393
Refresh one more time and wait for it.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.980
So let's refresh and then check one more time.

02:31.980 --> 02:33.600
And these are healthy.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.070
That looks good.

02:35.070 --> 02:35.970
So one more check.

02:35.970 --> 02:39.520
What we need to do is N look up, right NS look up

02:40.500 --> 02:45.330
and easier demo dot Q1 cloud.com.

02:45.330 --> 02:49.330
So it's resolving and it same means like this

02:50.958 --> 02:51.960
ABDNS name

02:51.960 --> 02:55.170
and this DNS name should have that same IPS right?

02:55.170 --> 02:58.290
So which is nothing but ingress DNS name.

02:58.290 --> 03:00.960
So 65 1 31 65, 1 31.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.250
This looks good.

03:02.250 --> 03:06.240
So now let's take this domain name and then go

03:06.240 --> 03:09.420
to the browser and then say new tab and then

03:09.420 --> 03:14.160
say st tp colon slash slash ecr demo dot q1 cloud.com.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.750
So index start, TM alert is

03:15.750 --> 03:17.610
at the root context automatically.

03:17.610 --> 03:20.010
Ideally it should load, right?

03:20.010 --> 03:21.120
So now we can see that.

03:21.120 --> 03:24.150
Welcome to stack simplify AWS EKS Masterclass.

03:24.150 --> 03:28.170
Inside that integration with ecs, ECR registry is completed.

03:28.170 --> 03:30.570
And then we are able to access the

03:30.570 --> 03:33.630
URL in the browser directly.

03:33.630 --> 03:37.957
So this completes end to end demonstration of whatever EKSN

03:38.814 --> 03:39.870
ESR.

03:39.870 --> 03:42.240
So now what we are going to do is we are going to clean

03:42.240 --> 03:44.190
up the manifest whatever we have created

03:44.190 --> 03:46.800
because we really don't want to bond our cash

03:46.800 --> 03:50.190
for this respect to load balancer URL primarily.

03:50.190 --> 03:54.360
Okay, so I'm going to say Q ctl, delete hyphen F

03:54.360 --> 03:56.850
and then zero two Q manifest.

03:56.850 --> 04:01.080
So whatever we have created, everything will get deleted.

04:01.080 --> 04:01.913
That's all, okay?

04:01.913 --> 04:05.130
So let's crosscheck everything got deleted or not.

04:05.130 --> 04:06.600
So if you go here

04:06.600 --> 04:10.200
and then load balances and then refresh, it's gone.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.060
Okay? So that's about it.

04:12.060 --> 04:13.890
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

04:13.890 --> 04:15.330
Until then, bye bye.

04:15.330 --> 04:16.163
Thank you.
