WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:01.080
-: Welcome back.

00:01.080 --> 00:04.440
In step seven, we are going to use this ECR image,

00:04.440 --> 00:08.880
whatever we pushed here in our EKS deployments, right?

00:08.880 --> 00:11.010
So we are going to understand that deployment

00:11.010 --> 00:13.050
and then service whatever we have created

00:13.050 --> 00:14.700
as part of this section, okay.

00:14.700 --> 00:17.280
So we are going to have a deployment NodePort service

00:17.280 --> 00:19.740
and then ALB Ingress service.

00:19.740 --> 00:22.290
So all these three files we are going to review

00:22.290 --> 00:25.410
and also, we are going to review the worker node related,

00:25.410 --> 00:27.780
ECR access related policy.

00:27.780 --> 00:29.130
And once we review these things,

00:29.130 --> 00:31.590
we'll go ahead and then deploy the stuff.

00:31.590 --> 00:34.380
So let's go back and then review the K8 manifest

00:34.380 --> 00:37.530
created as part of this section, right.

00:37.530 --> 00:39.540
So, we'll go to our visual studio code.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.760
Let me close this temporary thing,

00:41.760 --> 00:43.050
whatever we have created,

00:43.050 --> 00:44.670
close the docker file.

00:44.670 --> 00:48.150
And close this and let me maximize.

00:48.150 --> 00:51.058
And if you go here, 02-kube-manifests, okay.

00:51.058 --> 00:54.120
In 10 ECR, elastic container registry and EKS

00:54.120 --> 00:56.280
you can find 02-kube-manifests.

00:56.280 --> 00:59.370
So you'll have ECR NGINX deployment,

00:59.370 --> 01:01.170
ECR NGINX NodePort service

01:01.170 --> 01:04.320
and then ECR NGINX, ALB Ingress service.

01:04.320 --> 01:07.890
So let's start with ECR NGINX deployment, okay.

01:07.890 --> 01:10.650
So as usual, standard deployment,

01:10.650 --> 01:12.750
whatever we have created no change in it,

01:12.750 --> 01:14.700
how we have created deployments earlier

01:14.700 --> 01:16.170
it is the same thing.

01:16.170 --> 01:18.490
Only difference is, it will have the

01:19.800 --> 01:22.020
image, whatever we have created that URL.

01:22.020 --> 01:23.430
So, I can remove this.

01:23.430 --> 01:25.230
And even one more time,

01:25.230 --> 01:27.570
I can add it, okay.

01:27.570 --> 01:29.280
So what you need to do is,

01:29.280 --> 01:30.960
you need to go to this template

01:30.960 --> 01:34.080
and then update your image URL, here.

01:34.080 --> 01:37.380
Okay, so you need to update your image URL here

01:37.380 --> 01:39.510
to make your things work with the image

01:39.510 --> 01:42.600
whatever you push it to the ECR, right.

01:42.600 --> 01:46.770
So this is my image URL, right?

01:46.770 --> 01:49.890
So image URL, so you can see in repositories

01:49.890 --> 01:51.690
inside this repository.

01:51.690 --> 01:54.300
So this is the image URL, which I am planning to use.

01:54.300 --> 01:56.640
I copied it and then I pasted it.

01:56.640 --> 02:00.150
Okay, so resources also have given, that's fine, okay.

02:00.150 --> 02:03.030
So now you are going to run two replicas of that

02:03.030 --> 02:04.770
and this looks good, okay.

02:04.770 --> 02:07.320
So standard deployment definition.

02:07.320 --> 02:08.700
So that's the reason, one more time.

02:08.700 --> 02:11.220
I'm not going with the API version kind metadata

02:11.220 --> 02:12.690
all this stuff, okay.

02:12.690 --> 02:14.550
So, so far, we have done multiple times

02:14.550 --> 02:16.230
about the deployments.

02:16.230 --> 02:18.750
Same, we have created a NodePort service

02:18.750 --> 02:20.760
and only thing here is

02:20.760 --> 02:23.820
as we have created our image and then copied

02:23.820 --> 02:27.210
the index.html to the root context of html, right.

02:27.210 --> 02:29.040
Means like NGINX root context.

02:29.040 --> 02:33.360
So our run, healthcheck URL path/index.html.

02:33.360 --> 02:37.890
Earlier in our previous sections we have seen /app2 or /app1

02:37.890 --> 02:38.910
something like that, right.

02:38.910 --> 02:41.580
Here it is going to be index.html.

02:41.580 --> 02:44.340
Other than that, ports are going to be 80 and then 80,

02:44.340 --> 02:46.860
and they're standard NodePort service definition only.

02:46.860 --> 02:49.890
Okay, so we have done this from our fundamentals

02:49.890 --> 02:51.270
to now multiple times.

02:51.270 --> 02:53.100
Okay, so that's good.

02:53.100 --> 02:54.720
And next is ALB Ingress,

02:54.720 --> 02:57.203
in previous all sections we have done the same thing

02:57.203 --> 02:58.470
ALB Ingress.

02:58.470 --> 03:01.392
So, what we are going to do is like,

03:01.392 --> 03:03.150
so this is the one, right?

03:03.150 --> 03:07.080
So I'm also going to update the label here

03:07.080 --> 03:08.850
with the same label, okay.

03:08.850 --> 03:11.730
So just to have common labels conventions.

03:11.730 --> 03:14.550
So ECR Ingress service we are going to create.

03:14.550 --> 03:17.100
And then, so in its annotations

03:17.100 --> 03:20.250
so only the external DNS name you need to update

03:20.250 --> 03:22.440
if you want to with a different DNS name, right?

03:22.440 --> 03:24.180
Why? Because this is my DNS,

03:24.180 --> 03:26.760
so ecrdemo.kubeoncloud.com,

03:26.760 --> 03:28.350
we are going to create.

03:28.350 --> 03:31.110
And in the service name for /star here,

03:31.110 --> 03:34.950
you need to update your kube-ecr NodePort service

03:34.950 --> 03:36.900
related service name here, that's all.

03:36.900 --> 03:38.970
Okay, so this, you really don't need to change

03:38.970 --> 03:40.620
if you use the same templates,

03:40.620 --> 03:44.340
but the changes here include only the image URL,

03:44.340 --> 03:46.050
you need to change, right?

03:46.050 --> 03:47.280
So that is one.

03:47.280 --> 03:51.780
And the second is NodePort service, nothing changes.

03:51.780 --> 03:54.300
And in ALB Ingress, you need to change

03:54.300 --> 03:57.450
your ecrdemo.kubeoncloud.com.

03:57.450 --> 03:58.650
So in these templates,

03:58.650 --> 04:01.470
what you want to change is only primarily two things.

04:01.470 --> 04:03.510
One is image URL and deployment

04:03.510 --> 04:06.720
and ALB Ingress service related, host name,

04:06.720 --> 04:09.450
whatever you want to DNS register, that's all, okay.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.650
And that should be good.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.410
So this is about the manifest whatever we have created

04:13.410 --> 04:15.060
and then we are going to deploy.

04:15.060 --> 04:16.980
So let me close these things,

04:16.980 --> 04:19.380
and we have discussed all the manifests.

04:19.380 --> 04:21.010
So the next thing is to

04:21.990 --> 04:22.823
review the

04:25.230 --> 04:26.070
Access policy.

04:26.070 --> 04:27.720
IAM access policy, okay.

04:27.720 --> 04:31.470
So we need to go to EC2 here, right.

04:31.470 --> 04:32.400
So I'll go to EC2,

04:32.400 --> 04:35.610
how to find our role for our worker node group, right?

04:35.610 --> 04:38.820
So we'll go to running instances, right.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.730
And we'll check select any one of the instance

04:41.730 --> 04:44.760
and then which is related to our worker node group,

04:44.760 --> 04:46.170
you can cross verify that.

04:46.170 --> 04:48.837
So this is related to my EKS stuff only, okay.

04:48.837 --> 04:51.450
EKS demo one, NG private one, okay?

04:51.450 --> 04:54.570
And I'll go to description section

04:54.570 --> 04:56.790
and you can find the IAM role here, right.

04:56.790 --> 04:59.073
So I'll click on this role, right.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.733
And now if you see here,

05:01.733 --> 05:04.530
you should have something called Amazon EC2

05:04.530 --> 05:06.720
container registry read-only,

05:06.720 --> 05:09.690
and then Amazon EC2 container registry power user.

05:09.690 --> 05:11.790
Okay, so you'll have everything here, okay.

05:11.790 --> 05:13.590
Read-only, power user, okay?

05:13.590 --> 05:16.530
So I'll add this here in our documentation also.

05:16.530 --> 05:19.290
So these two policies should be associated.

05:19.290 --> 05:21.060
So these are already associated,

05:21.060 --> 05:23.790
how these are associated, also we can crosscheck here,

05:23.790 --> 05:24.623
right?

05:24.623 --> 05:28.050
So we can go here and then if we go to our EKS cluster

05:28.050 --> 05:29.850
using eksctl,

05:29.850 --> 05:33.720
and then if you see create EKS cluster in the node groups,

05:33.720 --> 05:36.510
so you'll find something called, you have created a cluster.

05:36.510 --> 05:39.630
And then whenever we are creating the node group, right?

05:39.630 --> 05:43.380
So you are saying here full ECR access, okay.

05:43.380 --> 05:46.050
So you are associating a policy for our node group,

05:46.050 --> 05:47.670
whatever we are creating.

05:47.670 --> 05:51.060
Saying that full elastic container registry access.

05:51.060 --> 05:53.970
Due to that we have got these policies associated

05:53.970 --> 05:55.920
for our worker node groups

05:55.920 --> 05:59.460
which means whatever the parts we are going to deploy,

05:59.460 --> 06:01.140
whatever the Kubernetes workloads

06:01.140 --> 06:03.570
we are going to deploy inside this node group

06:03.570 --> 06:07.620
are going to get that ECR full access automatically.

06:07.620 --> 06:09.210
Okay, so that's about it.

06:09.210 --> 06:10.950
So let me go back,

06:10.950 --> 06:14.850
and go to our 10 ECR, Elastic Container Registry.

06:14.850 --> 06:17.760
And if you see here, we have discussed here

06:17.760 --> 06:19.720
both the things related to

06:21.660 --> 06:22.560
K8 manifests,

06:22.560 --> 06:25.200
and then EKS worker modes, right?

06:25.200 --> 06:27.390
So in our next lecture we are going to deploy

06:27.390 --> 06:29.100
the Kubernetes manifest and then

06:29.100 --> 06:30.450
verify the stuff and then

06:30.450 --> 06:33.780
access that URL and then do the clean-up, right?

06:33.780 --> 06:35.460
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

06:35.460 --> 06:36.293
Until then, bye-bye.

06:36.293 --> 06:37.143
Thank you.
