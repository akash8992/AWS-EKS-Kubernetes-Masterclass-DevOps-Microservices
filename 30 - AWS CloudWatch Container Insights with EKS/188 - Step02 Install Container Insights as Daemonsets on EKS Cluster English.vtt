WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:01.290
-: Welcome back.

00:01.290 --> 00:03.513
So we are in 18 EKS,

00:04.350 --> 00:08.460
monitoring using CloudWatch Container Insights.

00:08.460 --> 00:11.310
So we already discussed about introductory topics

00:11.310 --> 00:14.400
about this one in our introduction section.

00:14.400 --> 00:17.400
So we are moving on to our step two, which is

00:17.400 --> 00:19.290
associate CloudWatch policy

00:19.290 --> 00:22.620
to our EKS worker node rules.

00:22.620 --> 00:26.160
So CloudWatch agent server policy need to be associated

00:26.160 --> 00:29.550
with our worker nodes EC2 role

00:29.550 --> 00:31.620
so that it gets the means like

00:31.620 --> 00:34.530
these worker nodes will get the access

00:34.530 --> 00:37.800
to push the logs to the CloudWatch,

00:37.800 --> 00:42.180
or send the metrics to the CloudWatch Container Insights.

00:42.180 --> 00:45.270
Or It gives the CloudWatch Container Insights to

00:45.270 --> 00:47.310
pull the information, whatever is present

00:47.310 --> 00:51.150
in other pod metrics or cluster metrics.

00:51.150 --> 00:53.820
So, so now let's go back to our management console,

00:53.820 --> 00:57.240
and what I said here is go to your EC2 worker nodes

00:57.240 --> 00:59.220
and then find the IAM role parameter

00:59.220 --> 01:00.540
and then click on that role.

01:00.540 --> 01:02.580
So that is the easiest way.

01:02.580 --> 01:05.580
So I can go to EC2, right?

01:05.580 --> 01:10.200
And I have two EC2 worker nodes running here,

01:10.200 --> 01:15.200
so I can say, so this and then this so I can go to them.

01:15.330 --> 01:19.080
So those are targeted with the respect to EKS only, right?

01:19.080 --> 01:21.990
So these are EKS demo one, NG private one.

01:21.990 --> 01:23.640
So which means those are deployed

01:23.640 --> 01:28.640
in our private subnets kubectl get nodes -o wide

01:29.970 --> 01:33.720
will give us the external IP if it is associated,

01:33.720 --> 01:37.590
you can tell that it is on the public subnet of our cluster.

01:37.590 --> 01:41.760
If it is none, it is on the private subnet of our cluster.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.950
So I'll go here, and then find

01:43.950 --> 01:46.980
the role EKS CTL EKS demo one, right?

01:46.980 --> 01:50.340
So from any one of the instance you can find your role,

01:50.340 --> 01:52.800
and then inside that role we are going

01:52.800 --> 01:57.180
to associate the policy CloudWatch agent server policy.

01:57.180 --> 01:59.850
So let me go here and

01:59.850 --> 02:03.180
it is loading so just give it a minute.

02:03.180 --> 02:04.620
I don't know why it is slow.

02:04.620 --> 02:05.453
Okay, got it.

02:05.453 --> 02:10.453
Okay, so now let's go here and attach a policy name

02:10.680 --> 02:14.400
CloudWatch agent server policy, right?

02:14.400 --> 02:18.360
So for our EC2 instance role worker EC2 instance role

02:18.360 --> 02:22.800
we have associated a new policy which is nothing

02:22.800 --> 02:26.730
but CloudWatch agent server policy, so that's good.

02:26.730 --> 02:30.810
So now let's come back and install the Container Insights.

02:30.810 --> 02:34.440
So Container Insights you can install specifically,

02:34.440 --> 02:37.920
which means like you can install one after

02:37.920 --> 02:39.600
the other means like it will have

02:39.600 --> 02:41.400
the components like CloudWatch agent

02:41.400 --> 02:43.410
and then FluentD CloudWatch agent

02:43.410 --> 02:45.330
is for our metrics to be pulled.

02:45.330 --> 02:50.330
And then you'll also have FluentD for pulling the logs also

02:50.520 --> 02:53.160
means like from logs from our EKS cluster.

02:53.160 --> 02:56.400
So you can independently install CloudWatch agent

02:56.400 --> 02:59.130
and then FluentD, or with a quick start option,

02:59.130 --> 03:00.990
you can install everything.

03:00.990 --> 03:03.870
So we are going to use the quick start option to

03:03.870 --> 03:06.090
install both of the stuff, okay.

03:06.090 --> 03:07.650
So now when you are installing it

03:07.650 --> 03:10.470
so what it does we are going to look into first, okay?

03:10.470 --> 03:12.660
So this command will install everything.

03:12.660 --> 03:13.860
Okay, so what is this command?

03:13.860 --> 03:16.380
We'll see in a bit but what it does is

03:16.380 --> 03:20.340
it'll create a new namespace named Amazon -CloudWatch

03:20.340 --> 03:22.650
in our Kubernetes cluster,

03:22.650 --> 03:26.520
and then it'll create necessary security objects required

03:26.520 --> 03:28.290
for creating that DaemonSet.

03:28.290 --> 03:31.320
So in simple terms it is going to create a DaemonSet,

03:31.320 --> 03:33.390
one DaemonSet for CloudWatch agent

03:33.390 --> 03:36.120
and then one DaemonSet for FluentD.

03:36.120 --> 03:39.270
So now we already seen DaemonSet when we are

03:39.270 --> 03:42.000
doing the x-ray section, if you remember, right.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.650
So it'll create per node one pod for us in the DaemonSet.

03:46.650 --> 03:50.130
So the number of nodes increases the pods per node

03:50.130 --> 03:52.440
one pod for FluentD and then one pod

03:52.440 --> 03:56.520
for CloudWatch agent will be always installed on each node.

03:56.520 --> 03:59.220
So in this step it is going to create security role

03:59.220 --> 04:02.190
cluster security account and then service account

04:02.190 --> 04:04.290
and then cluster roll binding, whatever is required.

04:04.290 --> 04:06.030
Further it is going to create

04:06.030 --> 04:08.940
and it deploys the CloudWatch agent responsible

04:08.940 --> 04:11.610
for sending the metrics to the CloudWatch

04:11.610 --> 04:14.490
as a CloudWatch service enables as DaemonSet

04:14.490 --> 04:17.220
and it also deploys the FluentD responsible

04:17.220 --> 04:20.640
for sending the logs to the CloudWatch as a DaemonSet

04:20.640 --> 04:23.130
and it deploys ConfigMap configurations required

04:23.130 --> 04:24.600
for this DaemonSet.

04:24.600 --> 04:28.950
So that's what this entire thing, so the entire CW agent

04:28.950 --> 04:32.160
and FluentD quick start dot AML is going to do.

04:32.160 --> 04:34.020
If you want you can open it,

04:34.020 --> 04:36.660
and then review it for your convenience.

04:36.660 --> 04:38.460
So means like you are now good

04:38.460 --> 04:40.290
at AML and then you are now good,

04:40.290 --> 04:44.430
at reading lots of Kubernetes manifests after writing them.

04:44.430 --> 04:47.070
So now you can see that it creates a namespace

04:47.070 --> 04:49.920
and then it creates a service account for us

04:49.920 --> 04:53.160
and it creates a cluster role binding and then cluster role

04:53.160 --> 04:57.210
and it also creates the configmaps for CW agent

04:57.210 --> 05:01.080
and then it creates the DaemonSet for CW agent

05:01.080 --> 05:03.780
with this information in the same way you'll have the same

05:03.780 --> 05:06.660
for our FluentD also in the down.

05:06.660 --> 05:07.830
So like that,

05:07.830 --> 05:10.052
so if we can review whatever, whatever, even

05:10.052 --> 05:12.300
whatever AWS has provided.

05:12.300 --> 05:15.400
Okay, so now what is this template and what is the three

05:15.400 --> 05:17.640
place then cluster name and region.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.890
So this is that template information, which means

05:19.890 --> 05:23.310
like this whole value whatever is there is the template.

05:23.310 --> 05:26.070
And then inside this you are sending cluster name value

05:26.070 --> 05:29.220
and then cluster region value so that in which region you

05:29.220 --> 05:32.940
are installing the CW agent and FluentD

05:32.940 --> 05:34.740
and in which cluster you are installing,

05:34.740 --> 05:35.670
you are providing those

05:35.670 --> 05:39.870
to your CW agent quick start dot aml.

05:39.870 --> 05:42.870
So in our class whenever, wherever you see cluster name

05:42.870 --> 05:44.580
underscore this in the red area

05:44.580 --> 05:45.990
here you are going to replace

05:45.990 --> 05:50.490
with your EKS demo one and region is US east one.

05:50.490 --> 05:53.070
So if you see here, that's what we have done here.

05:53.070 --> 05:54.660
So you can see right?

05:54.660 --> 05:56.850
So in for cluster name we have put

05:56.850 --> 06:01.200
EKS demo one and for region name we have put US east one.

06:01.200 --> 06:04.290
So now as we already completed the section

06:04.290 --> 06:06.000
which is associate cloud watch policy

06:06.000 --> 06:08.250
to our EKS worker nodes completed.

06:08.250 --> 06:10.680
So we can deploy this one now.

06:10.680 --> 06:15.300
So let's go here and then deploy it.

06:15.300 --> 06:19.050
Okay, so now it'll create associated stuff

06:19.050 --> 06:20.370
whatever is required for us.

06:20.370 --> 06:22.500
It first created the namespace

06:22.500 --> 06:25.350
then created the service account cluster roles

06:25.350 --> 06:28.140
and then cluster role bindings and then configmaps

06:28.140 --> 06:31.328
and the DaemonSet for respect to CloudWatch agent.

06:31.328 --> 06:34.167
Again, same for service account for FluentD cluster role

06:34.167 --> 06:36.630
cluster role binding and then configmap

06:36.630 --> 06:39.420
for FluentD, and it's equal and DaemonSet.

06:39.420 --> 06:41.970
So now once it is created so we can clear,

06:41.970 --> 06:44.850
and then we can say kubectl -f

06:44.850 --> 06:47.520
and then verify the DaemonSet here.

06:47.520 --> 06:52.020
Okay, so as we have already provided the respective role,

06:52.020 --> 06:55.530
ideally there should be ready two by two is ready in both.

06:55.530 --> 06:59.220
Why? Because we have kubectl get nodes, two nodes.

06:59.220 --> 07:01.500
So we'll have two DaemonSet means

07:01.500 --> 07:04.230
like DaemonSet is per node, it is going to run.

07:04.230 --> 07:05.910
So two CloudWatch agents

07:05.910 --> 07:09.180
and then two FluentD CloudWatches are going to run.

07:09.180 --> 07:12.450
Okay? So this completes the installation part

07:12.450 --> 07:16.410
of our Container Insights on our EKS cluster.

07:16.410 --> 07:18.390
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

07:18.390 --> 07:19.680
Until then, bye-bye.

07:19.680 --> 07:20.513
Thank you.
