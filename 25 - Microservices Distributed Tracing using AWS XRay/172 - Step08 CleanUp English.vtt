00:00.150 --> 00:01.050
-: Welcome back.

00:01.050 --> 00:03.900
In this lecture we are going to delete the applications

00:03.900 --> 00:06.990
created as part of this section, which is nothing

00:06.990 --> 00:09.810
but zero to applications, whatever we have done.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.940
So we are going to remove it.

00:11.940 --> 00:14.250
So rest all we are going to leave as is.

00:14.250 --> 00:17.430
Rest all in the sense whatever is extra demand running

00:17.430 --> 00:21.780
on these two nodes, so we are going to leave it as is.

00:21.780 --> 00:25.320
So why we are doing that. So there is a reason for that.

00:25.320 --> 00:28.020
So we are going to leave the accelerate set running

00:28.020 --> 00:30.510
which we will leverage in our next section

00:30.510 --> 00:35.220
related to canary deployments in Kubernetes on EKS.

00:35.220 --> 00:37.650
So whenever we do the canary deployment,

00:37.650 --> 00:39.720
so from user management service,

00:39.720 --> 00:43.920
it can distribute the traffic to V1 notification service 50%

00:43.920 --> 00:47.250
and for V2 notification service 50%.

00:47.250 --> 00:49.590
And when it is doing that, we need to see that

00:49.590 --> 00:52.080
in x-ray for our additional understanding.

00:52.080 --> 00:54.570
So for considering all those things,

00:54.570 --> 00:57.600
I want x-ray to be enabled.

00:57.600 --> 01:01.170
So that's the reason we are not deleting the

01:01.170 --> 01:02.760
accelerated functionality,

01:02.760 --> 01:05.790
which is nothing but accelerated functionality,

01:05.790 --> 01:10.080
which we have created in zero one section here.

01:10.080 --> 01:12.750
We are not removing that.

01:12.750 --> 01:14.580
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

01:14.580 --> 01:16.713
Until then, bye bye. Thank you.
