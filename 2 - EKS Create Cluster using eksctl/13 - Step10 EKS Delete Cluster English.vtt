00:00.000 --> 00:00.900
-: Welcome back.

00:00.900 --> 00:01.800
In this lecture

00:01.800 --> 00:04.200
we are going to look into delete EKS cluster

00:04.200 --> 00:06.330
and then node groups section, okay?

00:06.330 --> 00:08.820
So let's go into 0 1 0 4

00:08.820 --> 00:10.140
and we have the steps here.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.550
Before going into the steps

00:11.550 --> 00:14.220
we need to understand one thing thoroughly, okay?

00:14.220 --> 00:15.750
So one thing that is nothing

00:15.750 --> 00:18.360
but you have created your cluster

00:18.360 --> 00:20.730
and then node groups using EKSCTL

00:20.730 --> 00:25.500
and whatever the objects it has created as part of EKSCTL.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.930
If you're going to edit any of those things

00:27.930 --> 00:29.280
then we need to ensure that

00:29.280 --> 00:30.450
we need to roll back.

00:30.450 --> 00:33.600
Example, just now we have added one rule here

00:33.600 --> 00:36.930
in the EC2 management console for this security group

00:36.930 --> 00:38.130
which starts with the remote,

00:38.130 --> 00:41.040
means like which has the EKS iPhone remote access, right?

00:41.040 --> 00:41.873
So for this,

00:41.873 --> 00:43.140
what we have done is like

00:43.140 --> 00:46.710
we have added the all traffic here, correct, right?

00:46.710 --> 00:47.543
Which means

00:47.543 --> 00:50.730
so whenever you are planning to delete the cluster

00:50.730 --> 00:53.400
and then respect to note group or whatever it is, right?

00:53.400 --> 00:55.140
So roll back this change

00:55.140 --> 00:55.973
which is nothing

00:55.973 --> 00:58.680
but go here edit inbound rules

00:58.680 --> 01:00.690
and then remove these two rules

01:00.690 --> 01:02.130
related to all traffic

01:02.130 --> 01:04.650
and then leave it as the previous state.

01:04.650 --> 01:06.090
And then you can directly go

01:06.090 --> 01:07.470
and then delete the cluster

01:07.470 --> 01:09.870
which will also delete the underlying node group.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.160
First it will delete node group

01:11.160 --> 01:13.710
and then it all the node groups under that cluster.

01:13.710 --> 01:16.710
And finally it'll also delete the cluster control plan tool.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.510
So that is within one command

01:18.510 --> 01:20.130
you can delete everything

01:20.130 --> 01:22.200
after rolling back your changes.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.120
So this is the note one

01:24.120 --> 01:26.190
and note two is in our future sections

01:26.190 --> 01:28.830
whenever we are doing the story section or anything

01:28.830 --> 01:29.670
we'll also go

01:29.670 --> 01:32.700
and then update our worker notes, IAM policy,

01:32.700 --> 01:33.533
which is nothing

01:33.533 --> 01:35.520
but whatever we have seen here, right?

01:35.520 --> 01:37.500
So if you go to instances

01:37.500 --> 01:41.040
and if you click on this IAM role, right?

01:41.040 --> 01:42.000
So inside this

01:42.000 --> 01:45.840
we are going to add the role related to,

01:45.840 --> 01:48.960
we are going to attach a role related to CSI Driver

01:48.960 --> 01:52.710
means like EBS CSI driver related policy

01:52.710 --> 01:54.060
we are going to associate.

01:54.060 --> 01:55.110
So if that is the case,

01:55.110 --> 01:56.100
if you go and then again

01:56.100 --> 01:58.680
directly delete the cluster after your work or anything

01:58.680 --> 02:00.450
again it is going to be in trouble.

02:00.450 --> 02:01.380
So that's the reason

02:01.380 --> 02:04.110
whatever manually you have edited the objects

02:04.110 --> 02:06.570
created by EKSCTL,

02:06.570 --> 02:09.780
please ensure that you revert them back

02:09.780 --> 02:13.740
and then do the next step up deleting the cluster.

02:13.740 --> 02:14.640
If not,

02:14.640 --> 02:16.440
what is the problem, right?

02:16.440 --> 02:17.850
So if not, what is the problem?

02:17.850 --> 02:19.140
We'll see in a little bit.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.220
But for now,

02:20.220 --> 02:21.870
if you want to delete both node group

02:21.870 --> 02:22.703
and then cluster,

02:22.703 --> 02:23.700
you can use,

02:23.700 --> 02:26.820
you can directly use EKCTL delete cluster

02:26.820 --> 02:28.470
and then cluster name.

02:28.470 --> 02:30.510
So that first node group will get deleted

02:30.510 --> 02:33.000
and after that it'll also delete the cluster.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.640
And if you want to only delete the node group

02:35.640 --> 02:37.470
so then you can have like this,

02:37.470 --> 02:39.810
EKSCTL delete node group

02:39.810 --> 02:40.800
and the cluster name

02:40.800 --> 02:41.910
and then node group name

02:41.910 --> 02:43.710
and then it'll delete the node group first.

02:43.710 --> 02:45.270
And after that you can even go ahead

02:45.270 --> 02:46.680
and then delete your control plan,

02:46.680 --> 02:48.870
which is nothing but the cluster.

02:48.870 --> 02:50.580
So now one thing we are discussing is

02:50.580 --> 02:53.850
what happens if we don't revert back these things, right?

02:53.850 --> 02:56.010
Whatever we have edited the objects

02:56.010 --> 02:58.770
which are was created by EKSCTL.

02:58.770 --> 03:01.740
So what happens is some of the cloud formation events

03:01.740 --> 03:04.800
will fail here during the deletion.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.540
So you need to crosscheck

03:06.540 --> 03:08.400
what it fail and then go

03:08.400 --> 03:10.410
and then manually delete them

03:10.410 --> 03:12.470
and then work on it

03:12.470 --> 03:15.510
or again try to delete from cloud formation stack

03:15.510 --> 03:16.590
and ensure that

03:16.590 --> 03:17.910
whenever you click on the delete

03:17.910 --> 03:20.820
automatically it'll say that exclude this item.

03:20.820 --> 03:21.870
So check that box

03:21.870 --> 03:22.703
and then exclude

03:22.703 --> 03:24.060
and then delete it

03:24.060 --> 03:25.530
so that you'll be able to delete.

03:25.530 --> 03:28.860
But very important thing here is as part of this cluster

03:28.860 --> 03:31.470
it creates one NAD gateway

03:31.470 --> 03:34.320
which is already getting priced, right?

03:34.320 --> 03:35.190
In addition to that

03:35.190 --> 03:37.440
it also creates one network load balancer

03:37.440 --> 03:39.300
which is in the pricing state only.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.280
And it also created a lot of other stuff

03:41.280 --> 03:44.951
which means like per day it is charging dollar 2.5

03:44.951 --> 03:47.820
for this cluster control play.

03:47.820 --> 03:49.380
Considering all those things

03:49.380 --> 03:52.050
we should know how to delete this stuff,

03:52.050 --> 03:54.870
which means like how to ensure

03:54.870 --> 03:56.640
that we have deleted our cluster thoroughly

03:56.640 --> 03:58.920
after our work is completed.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.080
So the, for considering all these things

04:01.080 --> 04:02.326
I have ensured that.

04:02.326 --> 04:04.680
So this section is added for you

04:04.680 --> 04:07.080
with two important notes here.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.610
Let me come here.

04:08.610 --> 04:10.560
And so here, okay?

04:10.560 --> 04:11.430
So note one,

04:11.430 --> 04:12.263
and then note two,

04:12.263 --> 04:14.070
Like this whatever you change means like

04:14.070 --> 04:15.480
if you change something,

04:15.480 --> 04:17.370
if I change anything over the course,

04:17.370 --> 04:18.690
I'll add that here.

04:18.690 --> 04:20.340
But if you go and then change something

04:20.340 --> 04:21.930
please ensure that you remove them

04:21.930 --> 04:23.010
and then after that delete

04:23.010 --> 04:25.530
so that you don't run into issues.

04:25.530 --> 04:26.880
So that is the thing.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.620
So in our next lecture

04:28.620 --> 04:29.910
we'll focus on other stuff.

04:29.910 --> 04:31.050
Until then, bye-bye.

04:31.050 --> 04:31.883
Thank you.
