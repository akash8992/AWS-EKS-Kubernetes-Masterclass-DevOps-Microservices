00:00.150 --> 00:00.983
-: Welcome back.

00:00.983 --> 00:03.120
In this lecture, we are going to understand about

00:03.120 --> 00:06.600
EKS cluster pricing from our learning perspective.

00:06.600 --> 00:07.650
So which is nothing but,

00:07.650 --> 00:09.750
if we create the cluster and then if we leave it,

00:09.750 --> 00:12.000
then it is going to ball lot of money for us.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.460
So very important thing about EKS pricing

00:14.460 --> 00:16.320
is like EKS is not free

00:16.320 --> 00:18.840
like many of the other AWS resources,

00:18.840 --> 00:21.600
irrespective of if you have created our account in the,

00:21.600 --> 00:24.630
and we are in the first year of our AWS account,

00:24.630 --> 00:26.640
or it is an old AWS account.

00:26.640 --> 00:29.430
So in short, no free tariff for EKS.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.050
So EKS cluster pricing.

00:31.050 --> 00:32.370
Cluster pricing is nothing but

00:32.370 --> 00:34.860
the control plane pricing.

00:34.860 --> 00:38.700
So we paid $0.10 per hour in us-east-1

00:38.700 --> 00:39.840
North-Virginia region.

00:39.840 --> 00:43.050
All these are related to us-east-1.

00:43.050 --> 00:45.690
And it might vary based on different, different regions,

00:45.690 --> 00:49.170
but if we get a idea about what is the costing,

00:49.170 --> 00:52.110
accordingly how we want to create it and then use it,

00:52.110 --> 00:53.700
we get a fair idea, right?

00:53.700 --> 00:54.990
So that's the reason.

00:54.990 --> 00:55.823
So per day,

00:55.823 --> 00:57.990
if we keep running this control plan continuously,

00:57.990 --> 01:00.990
then it is going to be $2.4,

01:00.990 --> 01:02.460
and if we run it for 30 days,

01:02.460 --> 01:06.723
then it is going to end up with $72.

01:07.620 --> 01:11.040
So, which is not good if you run continuously,

01:11.040 --> 01:14.310
and then delay it, and then leave it open, right?

01:14.310 --> 01:16.410
So that's the reason when we are learning

01:16.410 --> 01:18.870
as part of this course, then we need to quickly delete

01:18.870 --> 01:21.150
and then recreate whenever we are using it.

01:21.150 --> 01:23.580
So in our next section we are going to do that,

01:23.580 --> 01:26.010
means like how you are going to delete your cluster

01:26.010 --> 01:29.430
and then how you are going to again recreate it,

01:29.430 --> 01:31.560
again you can follow the same steps of whatever

01:31.560 --> 01:34.200
in our previous section, but the whole idea is,

01:34.200 --> 01:36.480
you need to whenever you are working on it, create it,

01:36.480 --> 01:39.210
and then whenever you are not working on it, clear it.

01:39.210 --> 01:40.770
So that is the good option.

01:40.770 --> 01:42.870
So this is about the cluster pricing,

01:42.870 --> 01:45.030
and worker node pricing if we take,

01:45.030 --> 01:47.430
one T3-medium server itself, we will end up

01:47.430 --> 01:50.460
with $30 per month, if we continuously run it,

01:50.460 --> 01:53.490
and these worker nodes are running in the Kubernetes, right?

01:53.490 --> 01:54.940
So there is something called,

01:55.860 --> 01:57.180
they cannot be stopped,

01:57.180 --> 01:58.800
only you can delete your node group

01:58.800 --> 02:02.490
and then your T3-medium servers will be terminated.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.110
But you cannot stop the instances

02:04.110 --> 02:07.500
like regular EC2 instances, like stop and then start.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.750
So, if you take five days to complete this course,

02:09.750 --> 02:12.660
and if you run one EKS cluster and two T3-medium servers,

02:12.660 --> 02:14.580
already you'll end up with $25.

02:14.580 --> 02:16.290
If it is full day it is running,

02:16.290 --> 02:19.080
it's like five days X 24 hours it runs,

02:19.080 --> 02:21.480
it pays approximately around $25.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.160
So considering all these cases,

02:23.160 --> 02:26.460
we need to ensure that how we are going to plan, right?

02:26.460 --> 02:28.800
So if it is an organization-related account

02:28.800 --> 02:30.570
and then you are working for some organization,

02:30.570 --> 02:32.100
and their account you're using, that's fine.

02:32.100 --> 02:35.130
But whenever you're trying to use your own accounts,

02:35.130 --> 02:37.650
then you should be very careful about the pricing,

02:37.650 --> 02:39.870
even if you're using the Fargate Profile also,

02:39.870 --> 02:42.480
it has a dedicated pricing information here,

02:42.480 --> 02:43.830
you can refer.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.570
So two important points here is,

02:45.570 --> 02:47.250
if you're using your personal account,

02:47.250 --> 02:49.230
then ensure you delete and recreate clusters

02:49.230 --> 02:51.360
and worker nodes, as and when needed.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.130
In our next step, we'll see that.

02:53.130 --> 02:57.240
And important note two is, we cannot stop EC2 instances

02:57.240 --> 02:59.100
which are in Kubernetes cluster

02:59.100 --> 03:01.260
unlike other EC2 instances.

03:01.260 --> 03:03.600
So we need to delete the worker nodes or node group

03:03.600 --> 03:06.900
if we are not using it during our learning process, okay?

03:06.900 --> 03:07.860
So that's about it.

03:07.860 --> 03:09.510
So in our next lecture we are going to see

03:09.510 --> 03:14.310
how we are going to delete the EKS cluster, right?

03:14.310 --> 03:15.993
Until then, bye bye, thank you.
