00:00.120 --> 00:00.953
-: Welcome back.

00:00.953 --> 00:05.130
In this lecture we are going to install the eksctl CLI.

00:05.130 --> 00:08.400
So on your MacBook, if already Home Brew is installed,

00:08.400 --> 00:10.500
then ignore this step.

00:10.500 --> 00:15.123
So let's go ahead and then tap the weavework, tap here.

00:22.050 --> 00:25.890
So the next thing is install the weavework's Home Brew,

00:25.890 --> 00:28.083
tap eksctl binary.

00:35.970 --> 00:38.100
So it's already downloaded in my cache

00:38.100 --> 00:41.013
so the installation is pretty quick.

00:43.020 --> 00:47.430
So let me verify the version. Yeah, good.

00:47.430 --> 00:51.660
So we have completed the eksctl installation on our Mac.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.490
So if you want to install on Windows,

00:53.490 --> 00:56.460
you can follow the respect to documentation

00:56.460 --> 01:00.960
and then install it on the respective operating system.

01:00.960 --> 01:04.200
Either it is Linux or Windows.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.610
So in our next lecture,

01:05.610 --> 01:09.660
we'll focus on creating the EKS cluster.

01:09.660 --> 01:11.220
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

01:11.220 --> 01:13.023
Until then, bye bye. Thank you.
