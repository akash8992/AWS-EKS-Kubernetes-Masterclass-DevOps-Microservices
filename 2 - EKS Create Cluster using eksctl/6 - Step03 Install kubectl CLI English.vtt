00:00.030 --> 00:01.472
-: Welcome back.

00:01.472 --> 00:04.800
In this lecture we are going to install the kubectl CLI.

00:04.800 --> 00:09.800
So, AWS provides the EKS vendor kubectl binary.

00:10.200 --> 00:12.900
So, if we are using the EKS clusters,

00:12.900 --> 00:17.900
it is always recommended to use the their own kubectl binary

00:18.090 --> 00:21.750
so that we really don't run into many issues.

00:21.750 --> 00:24.180
So we can even download that directly

00:24.180 --> 00:26.370
using this reference link.

00:26.370 --> 00:28.410
So one important thing here we need to follow

00:28.410 --> 00:31.890
is based on the cluster version, whatever you are using,

00:31.890 --> 00:33.690
here the binary will be available

00:33.690 --> 00:38.263
for 1.13, for 1.14, 1.15 and then 1.16.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.580
So we are going to use 1.16.

00:41.580 --> 00:43.830
So this link and in my documentation,

00:43.830 --> 00:46.560
whatever you see it is going to be same.

00:46.560 --> 00:50.250
But whenever you are going to execute using my video,

00:50.250 --> 00:53.400
please ensure that you go to this reference link

00:53.400 --> 00:55.380
and based on the latest cluster version

00:55.380 --> 00:56.610
you are going to use.

00:56.610 --> 01:00.183
So from there you take the download link.

01:01.050 --> 01:03.660
Rest all commands you can execute as is.

01:03.660 --> 01:06.300
But for the download, the package link,

01:06.300 --> 01:09.420
always go to this documentation link.

01:09.420 --> 01:12.832
So now let's go ahead and then download this.

01:12.832 --> 01:16.233
So I'm just going to create a binary folder here.

01:19.264 --> 01:21.487
And I'm going to go inside that

01:25.380 --> 01:27.663
and I'm going to download the package.

01:33.150 --> 01:37.293
So let's provide the exhibit permissions for the binary.

01:40.770 --> 01:45.420
And set the path by copying it to the home directory.

01:45.420 --> 01:48.810
So we'll create a bin folder in our home directory

01:48.810 --> 01:51.513
and then we'll copy there and then set the path.

01:56.287 --> 01:58.953
And ones done, so let's verify that version.

02:02.220 --> 02:03.570
So we can see it here.

02:03.570 --> 02:08.570
V1.16.8-EKS means like the last Kubernetes service of AWS.

02:09.780 --> 02:14.631
So this respective kubectl binary is EKS vendor,

02:14.631 --> 02:17.940
AWS EKS vendor, binary which we are going to use.

02:17.940 --> 02:22.050
In our next lecture, we'll focus on installing the EKS CTL.

02:22.050 --> 02:23.283
Until then, bye bye.
