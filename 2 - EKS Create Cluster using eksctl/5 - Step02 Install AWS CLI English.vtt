00:00.150 --> 00:01.020
-: Welcome back.

00:01.020 --> 00:03.210
In this lecture we are going to install

00:03.210 --> 00:06.210
the AWS CLI on our Mac.

00:06.210 --> 00:10.470
So we need to first download the AWS CLI binary

00:10.470 --> 00:12.330
which is CLI V2 version.

00:12.330 --> 00:14.280
So we are going to use the latest version.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.650
These are the reference links for you to

00:16.650 --> 00:18.840
follow the documentation if you want,

00:18.840 --> 00:21.360
directly from AWS.

00:21.360 --> 00:24.900
So I just cut short and then used only whatever is required

00:24.900 --> 00:27.813
for me directly to install on Mac.

00:29.130 --> 00:32.643
I'm just going to download the binary and then install it.

00:35.820 --> 00:39.420
So it's going to get downloaded and once it is downloaded

00:39.420 --> 00:41.310
so using pseudo installer,

00:41.310 --> 00:44.529
I'm going to install the binary.

00:44.529 --> 00:46.279
So let's do that now.

00:49.116 --> 00:51.616
So let me provide my password.

00:55.740 --> 00:57.300
So it's installing now.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.410
So once install,

00:58.410 --> 01:03.210
so let's verify that version, right?

01:03.210 --> 01:07.577
So we should be in the latest version 2.0, right?

01:08.550 --> 01:12.060
2.0.22 as on today, right?

01:12.060 --> 01:17.060
So now we'll go to configuring the AWS command line.

01:18.330 --> 01:21.030
So if you want to install it on your Windows 10

01:21.030 --> 01:23.220
so you can follow these steps.

01:23.220 --> 01:25.170
And in addition to that, you have the reference

01:25.170 --> 01:28.800
documentation link to install it using the link also.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.090
Means like you can go to that link

01:30.090 --> 01:33.240
and then follow the AWS steps provided

01:33.240 --> 01:36.030
for installing it on Windows.

01:36.030 --> 01:40.110
So let me close these things and then go to configuring.

01:40.110 --> 01:41.100
So we need to go ahead

01:41.100 --> 01:43.740
and then generate the security credentials

01:43.740 --> 01:45.420
for our IAM account

01:45.420 --> 01:48.300
and then configure them on our command line.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.220
So let's do that now.

01:50.220 --> 01:52.200
So in the AWS management console,

01:52.200 --> 01:56.613
so let's search for IAM and go to IAM.

01:58.290 --> 02:00.390
And go to users.

02:00.390 --> 02:04.440
And I have the user Kalyan who is a admin user.

02:04.440 --> 02:07.200
So let me go to security credentials

02:07.200 --> 02:11.597
and then create the access key, right?

02:15.630 --> 02:18.120
And using this access key,

02:18.120 --> 02:22.800
we can copy it and then we can come here

02:22.800 --> 02:27.800
and then say AWS configure and base the access key here

02:29.970 --> 02:32.267
and the secret access key, right?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.950
And your default region,

02:37.950 --> 02:40.740
I'm going to select as us-east-1

02:40.740 --> 02:43.920
and my output is going to be JSON.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.600
So I configured it.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.820
So the next thing is to verify it.

02:47.820 --> 02:50.850
So whether it is successfully configured or not.

02:50.850 --> 02:53.790
So if I say AWS EC to describe VPCs

02:53.790 --> 02:57.540
I'm trying to execute some of the CLI commands

02:57.540 --> 02:58.860
like one CLI command here

02:58.860 --> 03:00.760
and then see what happens here, right?

03:03.390 --> 03:07.560
And I got the default VPC whatever is present there.

03:07.560 --> 03:11.070
So, which means like I am able to connect

03:11.070 --> 03:14.730
to my AWS account from my local command line,

03:14.730 --> 03:18.750
using AWS CLI and then fetch the information.

03:18.750 --> 03:20.160
So we are good with this.

03:20.160 --> 03:23.580
So that's about the installation of AWS CLI.

03:23.580 --> 03:25.590
In our next lecture we'll focus on

03:25.590 --> 03:27.750
installing the kubectl CLI.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.250
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.843
Until then, bye bye, Thank you.
