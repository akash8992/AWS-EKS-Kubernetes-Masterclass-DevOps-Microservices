00:00.120 --> 00:01.020
-: Welcome back.

00:01.020 --> 00:02.070
In this lecture,

00:02.070 --> 00:04.020
we are going to understand about

00:04.020 --> 00:07.050
three types of CLIs required for

00:07.050 --> 00:09.330
our AWS EKS clusters.

00:09.330 --> 00:10.380
In simple terms,

00:10.380 --> 00:13.920
to manage our application workloads on EKS cluster,

00:13.920 --> 00:14.850
we need to

00:14.850 --> 00:16.530
install three types of

00:16.530 --> 00:19.230
CLIs. Command-line Interfaces.

00:19.230 --> 00:20.370
So,

00:20.370 --> 00:22.680
the three types are AWS CLA,

00:22.680 --> 00:26.070
Cube CTL, and then, EKS CTL.

00:26.070 --> 00:30.480
So AWS CLA, we can control multiple AWS services

00:30.480 --> 00:31.560
from the command line

00:31.560 --> 00:33.570
and automate them through the scripts.

00:33.570 --> 00:36.540
So, this is a generic definition about AWS CLA.

00:36.540 --> 00:38.160
But why we need it

00:38.160 --> 00:39.930
for EKS cluster?

00:39.930 --> 00:41.190
So, why we need it is

00:41.190 --> 00:43.560
like once we configure the AWS CLA

00:43.560 --> 00:44.940
and then provide the

00:44.940 --> 00:47.190
security credentials on our local desktop

00:47.190 --> 00:50.280
with AWS CLA using Cube CTL

00:50.280 --> 00:51.863
and using EKS CTL,

00:51.863 --> 00:54.750
we will be able to manage our cluster

00:54.750 --> 00:56.220
and our cluster objects,

00:56.220 --> 00:59.460
and also our applications on Kubernetes clusters.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.600
So, all those things

01:00.600 --> 01:02.460
are required for that purpose.

01:02.460 --> 01:04.260
We need to primarily install the

01:04.260 --> 01:08.010
AWS CLA as the underlying base.

01:08.010 --> 01:10.020
Next is the Cube CTL.

01:10.020 --> 01:11.190
So Cube CTL,

01:11.190 --> 01:14.160
we can control Kubernetes clusters and objects using

01:14.160 --> 01:15.060
Cube CTL.

01:15.060 --> 01:17.430
So, most of the time in our entire course

01:17.430 --> 01:18.360
we are going to

01:18.360 --> 01:20.610
do everything with Cube CTL only.

01:20.610 --> 01:24.180
So, we can see step-by-step in our upcoming lectures.

01:24.180 --> 01:25.440
So EKS CTL.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.610
So, this is a very, very important

01:28.590 --> 01:31.170
and powerful tool for managing the

01:31.170 --> 01:33.720
Elastic Kubernetes Service Clusters.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.357
So, we even have the

01:35.357 --> 01:37.560
AWS Management Console

01:37.560 --> 01:39.660
wherein we will be able to create the cluster

01:39.660 --> 01:40.860
and then create the node groups.

01:40.860 --> 01:42.390
You'll understand about these objects

01:42.390 --> 01:43.417
in our upcoming lectures.

01:43.417 --> 01:44.550
"What is this cluster?"

01:44.550 --> 01:45.750
And then "What is control play?"

01:45.750 --> 01:46.830
and all these things.

01:46.830 --> 01:49.107
But for now, need to understand here is like

01:49.107 --> 01:50.633
EKS CTL is the

01:50.633 --> 01:52.170
better tool

01:52.170 --> 01:56.040
than the AWS Management Console as of today.

01:56.040 --> 02:00.120
So if using EKS CTL, we'll be able to

02:00.120 --> 02:04.110
create and then delete the clusters on AWS EKS.

02:04.110 --> 02:07.080
In addition to that, we'll be able to create autoscale

02:07.080 --> 02:09.240
and then delete the node groups.

02:09.240 --> 02:11.503
And we'll also be able to create the

02:11.503 --> 02:15.330
Fargate profiles using EKS CTL.

02:15.330 --> 02:16.260
In short,

02:16.260 --> 02:18.180
it is a very, very, very

02:18.180 --> 02:20.160
powerful tool for managing

02:20.160 --> 02:22.350
EKS clusters on AWS.

02:22.350 --> 02:25.200
So, let's go to our GitHub repo and then

02:25.200 --> 02:26.460
look into

02:26.460 --> 02:28.830
our steps, what we are going to perf.

02:28.830 --> 02:31.560
And in zero one EKS create clusters using

02:31.560 --> 02:33.600
EKS CTL.

02:33.600 --> 02:36.450
So as a first step, we are going to do the

02:36.450 --> 02:38.970
install CLIs now.

02:38.970 --> 02:43.324
So, in our next lecture we'll focus on installing the

02:43.324 --> 02:44.640
AWS CLI.

02:44.640 --> 02:45.900
I'll see you in the next lecture.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.040
Until then, bye, bye.

02:47.040 --> 02:47.873
Thank you.
