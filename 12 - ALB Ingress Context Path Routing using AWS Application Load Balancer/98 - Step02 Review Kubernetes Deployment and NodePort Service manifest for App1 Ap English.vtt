00:00.360 --> 00:01.380
-: Welcome back.

00:01.380 --> 00:04.110
Let's go back to our GitHub repository

00:04.110 --> 00:09.110
and we are in section 0803 ELB

00:09.300 --> 00:12.330
ingress context path-based routing.

00:12.330 --> 00:14.790
So as part of introductory section,

00:14.790 --> 00:17.580
we already discussed about the network architecture

00:17.580 --> 00:19.500
what we are going to implement

00:19.500 --> 00:21.720
and also the rules we are going to define

00:21.720 --> 00:22.980
for app one, app two,

00:22.980 --> 00:24.780
and then app three.

00:24.780 --> 00:26.760
So as part of this process,

00:26.760 --> 00:30.780
we are also going to move our health check path annotation

00:30.780 --> 00:32.340
at the service level,

00:32.340 --> 00:35.340
which is nothing but inside the node port service.

00:35.340 --> 00:38.010
So why we need to do that is because

00:38.010 --> 00:41.310
in the ingress service we can define a health check path

00:41.310 --> 00:43.860
if it is common for all the services

00:43.860 --> 00:45.060
or all the applications,

00:45.060 --> 00:47.280
whatever you are load balancing.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.200
So, but per application,

00:49.200 --> 00:51.270
you have different health check path.

00:51.270 --> 00:54.570
Then that respective application health check path URL

00:54.570 --> 00:55.650
should be configured

00:55.650 --> 00:58.800
inside that respective node port service.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.890
So in that line we are going to move the health check

01:01.890 --> 01:05.220
path-related annotation to the node port service

01:05.220 --> 01:07.410
of that respective application,

01:07.410 --> 01:08.250
app one, app two,

01:08.250 --> 01:09.930
and then app three.

01:09.930 --> 01:13.350
And let's go back over step two here,

01:13.350 --> 01:16.613
which is review Nginx app one, app two,

01:16.613 --> 01:19.170
and app three deployment and then service.

01:19.170 --> 01:21.933
Service is nothing but the node port service.

01:23.460 --> 01:26.310
So let's go to our Visual Studio Code here,

01:26.310 --> 01:29.920
and we are in section 0803 ELB

01:31.500 --> 01:33.630
ingress context path-based routing,

01:33.630 --> 01:37.650
and we are in 08 new ELB application load balancers,

01:37.650 --> 01:39.303
and inside that 0803,

01:40.410 --> 01:44.370
and in kube manifest folder we have 01, 02,

01:44.370 --> 01:45.870
and then 03 files.

01:45.870 --> 01:49.890
So 01 Nginx app one deployment and node port service,

01:49.890 --> 01:53.730
02 Nginx app two deployment and node port service,

01:53.730 --> 01:57.840
and 03 Nxinx app three deployment and node port service.

01:57.840 --> 02:01.020
And in app one deployment and node port service,

02:01.020 --> 02:02.940
so the standard deployment pattern

02:02.940 --> 02:06.570
and standard node port service-related manifests

02:06.570 --> 02:07.800
will be there here.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.420
Only differences, right?

02:09.420 --> 02:12.720
Only differences we are going to have here primarily

02:12.720 --> 02:16.140
are related to Kubernetes deployment,

02:16.140 --> 02:18.420
which is container image name,

02:18.420 --> 02:20.340
and for Kubernetes node port service,

02:20.340 --> 02:22.500
the health check URL path.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.090
So let's come back here,

02:24.090 --> 02:27.750
and this is the app one Nginx deployment.

02:27.750 --> 02:31.920
And replicas, we are going to create one pod here.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.810
And the selector match labels,

02:33.810 --> 02:37.860
you have the app one Nginx as the label here,

02:37.860 --> 02:39.990
app equal to app one Nginx.

02:39.990 --> 02:43.440
So the same thing need to be defined in your node port

02:43.440 --> 02:47.370
service-related selector app, app one Nginx.

02:47.370 --> 02:50.880
So now when you come to here in the image, right?

02:50.880 --> 02:53.100
In the port template spec, right?

02:53.100 --> 02:56.100
So stack simplifies slash kube Nginx

02:56.100 --> 03:00.810
app one will be your app one-related Nginx image.

03:00.810 --> 03:04.560
And when you go to the node port service here,

03:04.560 --> 03:07.020
the health check path for app one is

03:07.020 --> 03:10.500
slash app one index.html.

03:10.500 --> 03:11.670
So this is the thing.

03:11.670 --> 03:14.070
So this is the one which we need to move

03:14.070 --> 03:16.290
to those respective node port services.

03:16.290 --> 03:18.750
So need to add health check path annotation

03:18.750 --> 03:23.010
at service level if we are planning to use multiple targets

03:23.010 --> 03:24.360
in a load balancer.

03:24.360 --> 03:26.850
So accordingly we have ensured that

03:26.850 --> 03:28.740
for the app one Nginx,

03:28.740 --> 03:30.930
we have added the health check path

03:30.930 --> 03:32.790
in our node port service.

03:32.790 --> 03:36.240
So now if we go back to 02 Nginx deployment,

03:36.240 --> 03:40.260
so here also you'll see this is kube Nginx app two

03:40.260 --> 03:42.870
will be my image here.

03:42.870 --> 03:46.920
And health check path also is slash app two index.html.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.390
And remaining things,

03:48.390 --> 03:50.760
which is nothing but this is app two Nginx,

03:50.760 --> 03:52.620
so its label, selector match label,

03:52.620 --> 03:54.090
will be app two Nginx,

03:54.090 --> 03:56.340
and it's a selector in the node port service

03:56.340 --> 03:59.520
also going to be app two Nginx, right?

03:59.520 --> 04:03.540
So now let's go back over 03 Nginx app three deployment.

04:03.540 --> 04:07.050
And if you see here the image name is kube Nginx.

04:07.050 --> 04:08.700
So this is a root context here.

04:08.700 --> 04:11.340
There is no specific context like slash app one

04:11.340 --> 04:14.220
or slash app two inside this Nginx image.

04:14.220 --> 04:15.840
So it has a root context,

04:15.840 --> 04:17.460
and in the root context,

04:17.460 --> 04:20.190
you are going to have the index.html.

04:20.190 --> 04:23.910
So now let me also change this to app three.

04:23.910 --> 04:26.250
So everywhere you should see app three.

04:26.250 --> 04:28.980
So selector match labels, app three Nginx,

04:28.980 --> 04:31.440
and here also in the node port service also

04:31.440 --> 04:32.490
you'll see selector,

04:32.490 --> 04:35.730
and the label is app and app three Nginx.

04:35.730 --> 04:38.250
And another important thing we need to cross-check here

04:38.250 --> 04:39.600
is the health check path.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.760
So here we are going to check the root contact

04:41.760 --> 04:44.700
slash index.html as my health check path

04:44.700 --> 04:47.610
for my app three application.

04:47.610 --> 04:52.350
So these three are the applications we are going to deploy,

04:52.350 --> 04:55.020
and using ingress surveys, right?

04:55.020 --> 04:58.440
We are going to do the context path-based routing.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.270
So now let's come back here,

05:00.270 --> 05:03.870
and this completes the review of step two.

05:03.870 --> 05:04.890
In our next lecture,

05:04.890 --> 05:06.600
we are going to review step three,

05:06.600 --> 05:08.970
which is create ELB ingress context

05:08.970 --> 05:12.030
path-based routing Kubernetes manifest.

05:12.030 --> 05:13.650
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

05:13.650 --> 05:14.850
Until then, bye-bye.

05:14.850 --> 05:15.683
Thank you.
