00:00.330 --> 00:01.290
-: Welcome back.

00:01.290 --> 00:02.250
In this lecture,

00:02.250 --> 00:04.500
we are going to learn the pause

00:04.500 --> 00:09.270
and resume deployment options in our Kubernetes deployments.

00:09.270 --> 00:12.630
So let's go inside that 0404 pause

00:12.630 --> 00:15.690
and then resume deployments, right?

00:15.690 --> 00:19.560
So why do we need pausing and then resuming deployments?

00:19.560 --> 00:22.920
So if we want to make multiple changes to our deployments,

00:22.920 --> 00:24.450
we can pause the deployment,

00:24.450 --> 00:26.670
make all changes to our deployment,

00:26.670 --> 00:27.900
and then resume it.

00:27.900 --> 00:29.520
So if you don't do so,

00:29.520 --> 00:31.470
as soon as you keep applying the changes

00:31.470 --> 00:33.300
to your deployment, live deployment,

00:33.300 --> 00:36.960
then automatically the changes gets deployed

00:36.960 --> 00:40.320
and then parts get terminated and then recreated, okay?

00:40.320 --> 00:41.700
So what we are going to do is

00:41.700 --> 00:43.320
we are going to make two changes.

00:43.320 --> 00:45.930
One is we are going to make our application version

00:45.930 --> 00:50.520
from V3 to V4 as part of this pause and resume deployments,

00:50.520 --> 00:52.980
and one more change also we are going to apply

00:52.980 --> 00:56.430
about applying the CPU limits for our application.

00:56.430 --> 00:59.400
So we are going to do all those things, okay?

00:59.400 --> 01:00.870
So before that,

01:00.870 --> 01:02.670
check current state of your deployment

01:02.670 --> 01:04.620
and then application, right?

01:04.620 --> 01:07.770
So if you see kubectl rollout history deployment,

01:07.770 --> 01:09.060
my first deployment,

01:09.060 --> 01:11.403
and then see our application, current,

01:12.390 --> 01:14.880
rollout versions, whatever we have here, right?

01:14.880 --> 01:17.220
So we are at six with the kubectl

01:17.220 --> 01:19.050
added deployment here, right?

01:19.050 --> 01:22.350
So we are at six now, which means,

01:22.350 --> 01:24.990
and also verify your number of replica sets,

01:24.990 --> 01:27.570
how many you have currently, right?

01:27.570 --> 01:31.590
So mostly you should have four replica sets here, right?

01:31.590 --> 01:34.410
So now if you create one more version,

01:34.410 --> 01:37.350
one more replica set should get created, okay?

01:37.350 --> 01:39.990
Make a note of the number of replica sets present here.

01:39.990 --> 01:43.050
We have currently four replica sets present.

01:43.050 --> 01:45.270
And our rolling versions also we are seeing

01:45.270 --> 01:46.800
till six we are here.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.200
And one more thing is access your application

01:49.200 --> 01:50.910
and see the application version.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.980
So now I am accessing it,

01:52.980 --> 01:56.250
and if you see we are in the V3 version of our application.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.587
So let's go inside and then pause deployment

01:58.587 --> 02:01.050
and make these two changes, okay?

02:01.050 --> 02:05.100
So now what I'm going to do is kubectl rollout pause.

02:05.100 --> 02:07.110
And it's like I'm going to pause our respective

02:07.110 --> 02:08.820
my first deployment.

02:08.820 --> 02:10.983
So let's go ahead and then do that now.

02:11.910 --> 02:16.910
Kubectl rollout pause deployment

02:18.060 --> 02:21.843
and my first deployment, right?

02:23.670 --> 02:25.980
So once we have paused our deployment,

02:25.980 --> 02:28.260
so we can make whatever the changes we want to.

02:28.260 --> 02:30.510
So we are going to update our application

02:30.510 --> 02:33.840
from V3 to V4 using 4.0.0.

02:33.840 --> 02:36.480
Earlier whenever you have done this set image command,

02:36.480 --> 02:38.190
automatically changes happen

02:38.190 --> 02:40.290
and then all the parts got recreated,

02:40.290 --> 02:41.640
all those things, okay?

02:41.640 --> 02:43.500
So, but now whenever you do this,

02:43.500 --> 02:45.210
nothing should happen okay?

02:45.210 --> 02:48.090
So as our deployment got paused,

02:48.090 --> 02:50.670
whatever you do on the live deployment object,

02:50.670 --> 02:51.810
nothing should happen.

02:51.810 --> 02:53.730
So everything should be as is.

02:53.730 --> 02:55.020
So if you go ahead

02:55.020 --> 02:58.110
and then see the rollout history, okay?

02:58.110 --> 03:00.480
So we should see the same thing, which is nothing,

03:00.480 --> 03:02.730
but it is only at the sixth level, right?

03:02.730 --> 03:03.930
So no rollout history

03:03.930 --> 03:07.620
because it is in the deployment pause mode.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.330
If you see the replica sets,

03:09.330 --> 03:11.940
you should have the same count of replica sets,

03:11.940 --> 03:14.130
whatever you have seen earlier,

03:14.130 --> 03:16.260
which is four replica sets, right?

03:16.260 --> 03:18.720
So now if you resume the deployment,

03:18.720 --> 03:20.940
so then automatically changes will happen.

03:20.940 --> 03:24.770
Before that, we'll also make one more change saying that

03:24.770 --> 03:28.950
kubectl set resources for my first deployment

03:28.950 --> 03:31.620
with the, for the container kube Nginx,

03:31.620 --> 03:34.200
and I'm saying how much memory

03:34.200 --> 03:36.480
and then how much this one I'm going to allocate.

03:36.480 --> 03:37.710
I'm writing it here.

03:37.710 --> 03:41.130
So maybe I am using a simple cluster here,

03:41.130 --> 03:43.230
so this might be a bigger number,

03:43.230 --> 03:46.080
which is nothing but 52 MI and all those things.

03:46.080 --> 03:49.890
So I will say, okay, 30 MI, okay?

03:49.890 --> 03:53.220
30 MB or even less, okay?

03:53.220 --> 03:55.470
So I'm not even putting anything, right?

03:55.470 --> 03:59.580
So, and then I'm going to put 20, right?

03:59.580 --> 04:01.470
20 MCPU, okay?

04:01.470 --> 04:02.850
So instead of 200 MCPU,

04:02.850 --> 04:05.220
I'm just giving 20 MCPU, right?

04:05.220 --> 04:08.730
So, and then make this change, right?

04:08.730 --> 04:11.760
So why, because I'm using a T3 medium cluster.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.260
So ideally if I use this much,

04:13.260 --> 04:15.210
then I am already using 10 ports,

04:15.210 --> 04:16.830
so then it is going to create

04:16.830 --> 04:18.570
a lot of problem for us, okay?

04:18.570 --> 04:20.160
So this error you can ignore.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.500
So it's a timeout error, okay?

04:22.500 --> 04:25.380
The change got applied, okay?

04:25.380 --> 04:28.620
So now if you go ahead and then see your rollout history,

04:28.620 --> 04:29.970
still nothing should happen.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.790
We have made two changes but nothing should happen

04:32.790 --> 04:37.230
because still we didn't resume our deployment, right?

04:37.230 --> 04:39.390
So, and if you see the application version also,

04:39.390 --> 04:42.480
it will be only V3 only, okay?

04:42.480 --> 04:43.590
So now let's go ahead

04:43.590 --> 04:46.680
and then resume our application deployment.

04:46.680 --> 04:49.530
So kubectl rollout resume

04:49.530 --> 04:52.140
and then deployment slash my first deployment.

04:52.140 --> 04:54.000
So let me do that.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.800
So as soon as we do this

04:55.800 --> 04:58.410
and then see the rollout history,

04:58.410 --> 05:00.780
then you should see the seventh version coming in.

05:00.780 --> 05:02.730
You see the kubectl get ports

05:02.730 --> 05:05.910
and they should get created, right?

05:05.910 --> 05:07.200
And then few are terminating

05:07.200 --> 05:09.030
and then few are creating.

05:09.030 --> 05:12.630
So all these things happens now, okay?

05:12.630 --> 05:14.850
And we can go ahead

05:14.850 --> 05:16.380
and then access our application

05:16.380 --> 05:18.810
and see what happens, okay?

05:18.810 --> 05:21.510
So let me go to my application

05:21.510 --> 05:23.730
and then access it once all ports are ready.

05:23.730 --> 05:26.700
And also let's cross-check our replica sets count,

05:26.700 --> 05:28.290
get RS, right?

05:28.290 --> 05:31.230
Earlier it is four replica sets

05:31.230 --> 05:34.890
and now as it is 4.0.0 version,

05:34.890 --> 05:36.870
we should have five replica sets, okay?

05:36.870 --> 05:38.610
One, two, three, four, five.

05:38.610 --> 05:39.450
That's good.

05:39.450 --> 05:42.300
So now let's go ahead and then access our application.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.750
We should see the V4 version of our application.

05:45.750 --> 05:48.210
See now we have the V4 version.

05:48.210 --> 05:51.270
So we have successfully tested

05:51.270 --> 05:53.250
in deployment the following things.

05:53.250 --> 05:56.520
Creating a deployment, scaling the deployment,

05:56.520 --> 05:59.760
exposing the deployment as in node port service,

05:59.760 --> 06:01.710
and updating the deployment

06:01.710 --> 06:04.170
with two options available for us,

06:04.170 --> 06:07.050
which is set image and then edit deployment.

06:07.050 --> 06:09.870
And also we have rolled back the deployments

06:09.870 --> 06:11.430
using to previous version

06:11.430 --> 06:13.380
and to specific version.

06:13.380 --> 06:14.720
And in addition to that,

06:14.720 --> 06:18.720
we also tested the pause and then resume deployment.

06:18.720 --> 06:22.140
So this completes the deployment section

06:22.140 --> 06:24.360
using the imperative commands.

06:24.360 --> 06:27.240
So let's go ahead and then do the clean up

06:27.240 --> 06:30.240
of whatever we have created, right?

06:30.240 --> 06:34.980
So kubectl get deployments

06:34.980 --> 06:38.220
and then delete deployment, right?

06:38.220 --> 06:43.220
Delete, deploy, and my first deployment got deleted, right?

06:46.050 --> 06:50.490
In the same way, delete SVC, right?

06:50.490 --> 06:54.900
So before that we'll get the name of the service, get SVC,

06:54.900 --> 06:59.900
and then delete service, my first deployment service, right?

07:02.970 --> 07:05.940
So now if you see kubectl get all

07:05.940 --> 07:08.010
from our default name space,

07:08.010 --> 07:10.710
other than cluster IPF Kubernetes,

07:10.710 --> 07:11.730
nothing should be there.

07:11.730 --> 07:14.340
So we have completely cleaned up everything.

07:14.340 --> 07:16.680
So this completes that deployment section,

07:16.680 --> 07:19.980
and in our next section is going to be services,

07:19.980 --> 07:24.390
and then we will see services concepts in our next section.

07:24.390 --> 07:26.220
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

07:26.220 --> 07:27.570
Until then, bye-bye.

07:27.570 --> 07:28.403
Thank you.
