00:00.210 --> 00:01.080
-: Welcome back.

00:01.080 --> 00:02.940
In this lecture we are going to work

00:02.940 --> 00:05.250
on updating our Deployments.

00:05.250 --> 00:10.140
So we are going to go into 0 4 0 2, update Deployment.

00:10.140 --> 00:13.500
And if you see here we can do the update Deployment using

00:13.500 --> 00:17.580
either set image, or edit Deployment options.

00:17.580 --> 00:20.580
So in step one, we'll use set image

00:20.580 --> 00:24.930
and in step two, we are going to use the edit Deployment.

00:24.930 --> 00:27.660
So, and then there will be multiple things to understand

00:27.660 --> 00:30.510
and then multiple observations we need to make

00:30.510 --> 00:31.590
when we are doing this.

00:31.590 --> 00:33.720
So that will be in this model

00:33.720 --> 00:36.870
we'll get a lot of knowledge on what we are doing.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.723
So let's go up and then,

00:40.710 --> 00:45.330
so for the update Deployment using set image, right?

00:45.330 --> 00:46.980
So one thing we need to do is

00:46.980 --> 00:50.280
like we need to get the container name correctly.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.600
So first thing is if

00:51.600 --> 00:53.850
let's see the update Deployment command.

00:53.850 --> 00:57.300
So cube CTL, set image, and then Deployment,

00:57.300 --> 00:59.010
and the Deployment name,

00:59.010 --> 01:03.000
and container name is equal to container image.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.850
So here, we need to have the container name.

01:05.850 --> 01:08.880
So to get this container name, we can get that

01:08.880 --> 01:13.380
container name using this command, cube CTL, get Deployment.

01:13.380 --> 01:16.170
Deployment name, hyphen O AML,

01:16.170 --> 01:19.410
and where we can find it is, spec dot, container name.

01:19.410 --> 01:21.120
There we can find it.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.153
So let's find our container name.

01:26.550 --> 01:30.480
So if you go up, you can see that spec dot,

01:30.480 --> 01:32.190
container start, name,

01:32.190 --> 01:34.920
and then you can find cube engine X.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.680
So that's our container name.

01:37.680 --> 01:41.970
So in cube CTL set image, Deployment, Deployment name

01:41.970 --> 01:44.700
and then container name is cube NGX is equal

01:44.700 --> 01:47.610
to my new container image, which is nothing

01:47.610 --> 01:50.130
but stack simplifies slash, cube NGX,

01:50.130 --> 01:52.470
colon two dot zero dot zero.

01:52.470 --> 01:55.350
So earlier we have used one dot zero dot zero.

01:55.350 --> 01:57.450
So that's the reason our application is coming

01:57.450 --> 01:59.220
as application V one.

01:59.220 --> 02:02.220
So now if we are going to update it to

02:02.220 --> 02:04.020
two dot zero dot zero.

02:04.020 --> 02:06.720
So let's go ahead and then do that now.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.780
So cube CTL, set image, and then this one.

02:09.780 --> 02:13.380
And then we said that hyphen hyphen record true

02:13.380 --> 02:15.330
for our versioning rollout.

02:15.330 --> 02:20.330
Versioning to be enabled. Copy and come here and paste it.

02:23.880 --> 02:27.960
Right? So now our Deployment got updated immediately

02:27.960 --> 02:31.773
we can see the rollout status here.

02:32.790 --> 02:35.310
So waiting for the Deployment and out of nine

02:35.310 --> 02:36.570
nine of 10 updated.

02:36.570 --> 02:38.463
And finally 10th one also updated.

02:39.668 --> 02:42.270
So using rollout status, you can see how the rollout

02:42.270 --> 02:43.140
is going to happen.

02:43.140 --> 02:46.470
Now if you see the cube CTL get forwards

02:46.470 --> 02:50.550
then ideally you see that all the pods got recreated

02:50.550 --> 02:53.190
which means its age is only 23 seconds

02:53.190 --> 02:55.560
just now it got created.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.830
So with the new image, right? So now you can even

02:58.830 --> 03:02.700
see cube CTL get deployed, right?

03:02.700 --> 03:04.350
So to see that all are up

03:04.350 --> 03:08.580
and running up to date and then available is 10.

03:08.580 --> 03:10.620
So now describe the Deployment.

03:10.620 --> 03:12.450
So by describing the Deployment

03:12.450 --> 03:14.100
what we are going to understand

03:14.100 --> 03:17.070
we can verify that events and understand that Kubernetes

03:17.070 --> 03:21.060
by default do rolling update for new application releases.

03:21.060 --> 03:22.530
So what is the rolling update

03:22.530 --> 03:25.230
and then why we do rolling update by default?

03:25.230 --> 03:28.140
So when the Kubernetes does the rolling update

03:28.140 --> 03:29.910
what happens is like the downtime

03:29.910 --> 03:32.640
of our application is going to be zero, right?

03:32.640 --> 03:36.360
So one after the other it is going to update our parts

03:36.360 --> 03:39.669
and there is one more strategy in this update Deployment.

03:39.669 --> 03:42.300
There is one more strategies in addition to rolling

03:42.300 --> 03:44.640
there will be something called recreate.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.290
So if it recreates, which means

03:46.290 --> 03:48.420
like it'll delete all the parts

03:48.420 --> 03:50.790
and then recreate at that time.

03:50.790 --> 03:53.280
So at that time you can expect the downtime

03:53.280 --> 03:54.555
for your application.

03:54.555 --> 03:57.150
By default it is going to be rolling update.

03:57.150 --> 03:59.294
So we really don't need to define anything even

03:59.294 --> 04:03.000
in our Deployment spec itself whenever we are

04:03.000 --> 04:05.130
writing the YAML manifest.

04:05.130 --> 04:08.110
But there will be some cases like my skill

04:09.000 --> 04:12.060
my skill containers are these things wherein

04:12.060 --> 04:14.010
you want to recreate the stuff.

04:14.010 --> 04:17.340
So in those cases you can use the recreate strategy

04:17.340 --> 04:21.410
but in general applications, whatever you use

04:21.410 --> 04:24.628
99.99% will be using the rolling update.

04:24.628 --> 04:28.530
So that's the reason is by default defaulted it.

04:28.530 --> 04:33.000
Okay, so let's go here and then describe our Deployment

04:33.000 --> 04:37.410
cube ctl, describe Deployment, and my Deployment name.

04:37.410 --> 04:42.410
Right? So, let's see the events here once it comes, right?

04:46.440 --> 04:47.850
So you can see it here.

04:47.850 --> 04:51.030
So it has done a rolling update one after the other.

04:51.030 --> 04:52.789
Okay, scaled up replica said

04:52.789 --> 04:55.410
and then it started updating one

04:55.410 --> 04:56.790
after the other, one after the other

04:56.790 --> 05:00.210
and then it already completed all the things.

05:00.210 --> 05:02.370
Okay, so one important thing we need to notice here

05:02.370 --> 05:03.810
is the replica set.

05:03.810 --> 05:06.900
So whenever we have done the update, it is going to

05:06.900 --> 05:08.673
create a new replica set.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.510
So the old replica set becomes zero

05:12.510 --> 05:13.710
and the new replica set.

05:13.710 --> 05:16.800
So 26 minutes back we created the first Deployment

05:16.800 --> 05:18.390
in our previous section.

05:18.390 --> 05:21.420
At that time this replica set is created means like

05:21.420 --> 05:24.792
with this replica set we have the old version 1 dot 0 dot 0

05:24.792 --> 05:27.060
and it created a new replica set

05:27.060 --> 05:30.270
with the two dot zero dot zero off our application.

05:30.270 --> 05:33.450
So this is one more observation which we need to know.

05:33.450 --> 05:36.210
And one more thing is get pods, okay?

05:36.210 --> 05:37.680
Pod template, hash label.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.930
So this also you can compare and understand

05:39.930 --> 05:41.400
that it's a different one.

05:41.400 --> 05:45.060
So let's see here our pod and then template.

05:45.060 --> 05:47.550
So pod template, hash label, you can see it here

05:47.550 --> 05:50.340
it is pointing to our second replica set

05:50.340 --> 05:52.260
whatever it got created.

05:52.260 --> 05:54.660
So recently, which is two minutes back.

05:54.660 --> 05:56.460
Okay? So that's about it

05:56.460 --> 06:00.930
and verify your rollout history of a Deployment.

06:00.930 --> 06:03.720
So we have that rollout history so we can switch back

06:03.720 --> 06:06.450
to older versions using revision history available

06:06.450 --> 06:08.550
to us in our next section.

06:08.550 --> 06:12.330
So 0 4 0 3, we are going to do the rollbacks.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.400
So at that time this will be helpful

06:14.400 --> 06:17.490
but now we are going to just see the rollout history

06:17.490 --> 06:21.210
of our my first Deployment application

06:21.210 --> 06:24.600
right cube CTL, rollout, history, deployment,

06:24.600 --> 06:26.040
and then deployment name.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.680
So it says that the version is 2 dot 0 dot 0

06:28.680 --> 06:30.240
and this is the second one.

06:30.240 --> 06:33.000
So we have recorded it so it is true.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.720
So now the last thing is access your application.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.700
So already I have it in our browser, but

06:38.700 --> 06:41.410
if you want you can go and then go to cube ctl

06:42.390 --> 06:46.230
get avc, and then get the note pod here

06:46.230 --> 06:50.430
three two one six nine and get notes iPhone.

06:50.430 --> 06:54.330
Why? To get your external IP and then access it.

06:54.330 --> 06:55.500
I already have it here.

06:55.500 --> 06:56.580
3 2 1 6 9.

06:56.580 --> 07:01.290
So if I refresh it, so now it is avc, it should become v2.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.810
See now my application version is V2

07:03.810 --> 07:07.020
and the background also got change two sky blue color.

07:07.020 --> 07:08.340
So that's about it.

07:08.340 --> 07:11.550
So now our successful Deployment has been happen means

07:11.550 --> 07:15.960
like we updated our Deployment using the set image option

07:15.960 --> 07:19.740
without any issues and all these observations we have done.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.840
So in our next lecture we'll focus

07:21.840 --> 07:25.500
on doing it using cube CTL added Deployment.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.240
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

07:27.240 --> 07:28.590
Until then, bye bye.

07:28.590 --> 07:29.423
Thank you.
