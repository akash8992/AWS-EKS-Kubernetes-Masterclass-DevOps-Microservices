00:00.150 --> 00:00.990
-: Welcome back.

00:00.990 --> 00:04.170
In this lecture we are going to expose Replica set

00:04.170 --> 00:08.032
as a service so that we'll be able to access the application

00:08.032 --> 00:12.240
present in Replica set parts via browser.

00:12.240 --> 00:15.000
So let's go ahead and then do that now.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.980
So we are going to say Q CTL expose Replica set,

00:19.980 --> 00:20.813
which is nothing

00:20.813 --> 00:25.590
but RS and the RS name Replica set name and the type

00:25.590 --> 00:28.890
is going to be node port and rest All is going to be same.

00:28.890 --> 00:30.390
Port is the service port,

00:30.390 --> 00:33.510
which is cluster IP port and the target port is nothing

00:33.510 --> 00:37.860
but the 80 80 which is nothing but my application port

00:37.860 --> 00:39.570
whatever it is, running my container.

00:39.570 --> 00:43.380
Port Cube Hollow World container Port is 80 80.

00:43.380 --> 00:46.020
And the name of the service is going to be my Hollow

00:46.020 --> 00:47.940
World RS service.

00:47.940 --> 00:51.363
So let's go ahead and then do this now.

01:00.270 --> 01:03.270
Right? So it's completed.

01:03.270 --> 01:08.270
So now let's go ahead and then get the the service,

01:08.850 --> 01:13.237
right? and you have it as 3 0 5 0 5.

01:14.588 --> 01:19.320
And get notes hyphen OY to get the public IP.

01:19.320 --> 01:23.490
And the public IP is this one external IP

01:23.490 --> 01:26.163
and the port is 3 0 5 0 5.

01:28.993 --> 01:30.343
Right? So let's go here and

01:32.160 --> 01:35.733
3 0 5 0 5 slash hello.

01:37.410 --> 01:38.400
and we got this.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.310
Okay, so let me make it bigger.

01:41.310 --> 01:46.310
And now if you want to refresh and you can take the same URL

01:47.850 --> 01:51.120
and in new tab one more time access it.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.220
You see one more value here, okay?

01:53.220 --> 01:55.103
And in one more time and you can do one more time.

01:58.350 --> 01:59.760
So like this you can access

01:59.760 --> 02:01.860
and then it will keep load balancing.

02:01.860 --> 02:04.650
So if you see here it is D seven H B K

02:04.650 --> 02:06.873
here it is Z N B G W.

02:07.736 --> 02:09.450
So to which container it is going that respective

02:09.450 --> 02:10.650
to container's id

02:10.650 --> 02:13.410
it is going to throw it here on the browser.

02:13.410 --> 02:15.690
So let's see what does that mean?

02:15.690 --> 02:20.100
Okay, I said cube CTL get ports. So you see it, right?

02:20.100 --> 02:24.332
The request went to Z N B G W container, okay

02:24.332 --> 02:26.370
so that's what it is showing here.

02:26.370 --> 02:29.730
And another request went to D seven H V K.

02:29.730 --> 02:31.530
So and then you have this here.

02:31.530 --> 02:35.250
So like that I have written a springboard code means like

02:35.250 --> 02:38.790
java code in my container and then packaged it

02:38.790 --> 02:42.090
so that now whatever to which container it goes.

02:42.090 --> 02:43.800
That respect to container already you are going to

02:43.800 --> 02:46.590
see it here just for fun, okay?

02:46.590 --> 02:48.420
So nothing much inside that

02:48.420 --> 02:51.690
but you need to access your application in this manner.

02:51.690 --> 02:54.510
Okay? So node one, public IP colon node

02:54.510 --> 02:57.750
port whatever we have got and then slash hello the context

02:57.750 --> 02:59.400
of this application is slash hello

02:59.400 --> 03:02.850
because it is a hello world application.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.550
In our next step what we are going to do is we

03:05.550 --> 03:08.610
are going to test the replica set reliability

03:08.610 --> 03:11.880
or high availability. So what does this mean?

03:11.880 --> 03:15.120
So whenever a port is accidentally terminated due to

03:15.120 --> 03:16.506
some application issue

03:16.506 --> 03:19.470
replica set should auto create that port to

03:19.470 --> 03:22.470
maintain the designed number of replicas.

03:22.470 --> 03:25.440
So that's what is replica sets reliability are

03:25.440 --> 03:27.120
high availability concept.

03:27.120 --> 03:30.690
So you have here three ports running, right?

03:30.690 --> 03:34.920
So and if you go ahead and then delete one pod cube CTL,

03:34.920 --> 03:38.520
delete pod and then delete one port.

03:38.520 --> 03:41.220
So you are trying to simulate the accidental deletion.

03:41.220 --> 03:45.600
Okay? So automatically it should start creating one

03:45.600 --> 03:50.600
more pod replica said will create the pod immediately.

03:53.070 --> 03:55.770
So there is some connectivity issue but we'll

03:55.770 --> 03:57.540
try one more time.

03:57.540 --> 04:00.450
Okay, so now the port got delete.

04:00.450 --> 04:03.630
So let's test this with QCTL get ports.

04:03.630 --> 04:06.840
So once we have deleted the port and now you see

04:06.840 --> 04:11.560
that the all the two parts whatever are there is age

04:12.628 --> 04:14.700
of 27 minutes, but whatever you have deleted and then

04:14.700 --> 04:18.330
replica has automatically created a new port which is of

04:18.330 --> 04:19.500
95 seconds.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.780
If you want we can delete one more couple

04:21.780 --> 04:24.610
of parts one more time, okay Q CTL delete port

04:24.610 --> 04:28.020
and then we'll also delete our D seven H V K pod.

04:28.020 --> 04:29.250
Okay? So and then

04:29.250 --> 04:33.090
in that place replica set should create one more pod.

04:33.090 --> 04:35.403
So let's see that now.

04:45.210 --> 04:48.510
Q CTL get ports.

04:48.510 --> 04:52.290
Now you can see that, so D seven HVK is gone and then

04:52.290 --> 04:57.290
you have got in that place 27 4 mg new port 16 seconds.

04:58.710 --> 04:59.543
It's H.

04:59.543 --> 05:02.510
So you can see the first one port is from 28 minutes

05:02.510 --> 05:05.910
it is running, the other is from two minutes and this is

05:05.910 --> 05:07.620
from 16 seconds.

05:07.620 --> 05:12.150
So what here Replica set is doing is, it is automatically

05:12.150 --> 05:15.510
creating the ports to ensure that the number of replicas

05:15.510 --> 05:18.300
whatever we have configured here, right?

05:18.300 --> 05:20.160
So it is trying to ensure that the number

05:20.160 --> 05:23.550
of replicas are going to be three always.

05:23.550 --> 05:28.550
So that's about the replica set reliability are

05:28.620 --> 05:30.150
high availability concept.

05:30.150 --> 05:34.080
So the next concept is replica sets scalability feature.

05:34.080 --> 05:38.520
So we can simply scale our replica set just

05:38.520 --> 05:41.971
by updating our spec here, right?

05:41.971 --> 05:43.740
So we can go into our spec.

05:43.740 --> 05:48.740
So let me go here and this is my replica set right?

05:49.320 --> 05:51.790
So, and then I will say here

05:55.500 --> 06:00.030
Six replicas and then save it and then apply

06:00.030 --> 06:03.000
that change which is nothing but cube CTL replace

06:03.000 --> 06:06.135
and the same file. Okay, let me see.

06:06.135 --> 06:10.290
Clear and past cube CTL replace hyphen F

06:10.290 --> 06:13.023
and the replica set demo dot YML.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.443
And let's see what happens.

06:17.310 --> 06:20.313
So now our replica set got replaced.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.880
Cube CTL get RS the replica set we are going to

06:23.880 --> 06:27.360
see now you see that desired replicas are going to be six

06:27.360 --> 06:29.340
current is six and then ready is six.

06:29.340 --> 06:33.330
So I'll say get ports and then you should see six

06:33.330 --> 06:36.900
ports up and running here now, right?

06:36.900 --> 06:37.770
So that's about it.

06:37.770 --> 06:40.500
So from last 22 seconds we have three parts came

06:40.500 --> 06:42.030
up online automatically.

06:42.030 --> 06:46.032
So in this way you'll be able to scale your replica set

06:46.032 --> 06:48.990
quickly by updating the number of replicas

06:48.990 --> 06:52.680
in your replica set demo dot YML.

06:52.680 --> 06:53.970
So that's about it.

06:53.970 --> 06:56.490
And now the next thing is to delete the replica set

06:56.490 --> 06:57.323
in the service.

06:57.323 --> 07:00.030
So we are trying to clean up the stuff.

07:00.030 --> 07:02.680
Okay, so let's go ahead and then

07:03.960 --> 07:08.910
get RS. So we'll get the Replica name, cube CTL

07:08.910 --> 07:13.910
delete RS, and we are going to say my hello word RS

07:16.710 --> 07:17.790
The same way.

07:17.790 --> 07:20.910
Get SVC, which is nothing but Q CTL.

07:20.910 --> 07:25.910
Get services and Q CTL delayed SVC,

07:26.280 --> 07:28.683
my hello world service.

07:30.780 --> 07:33.630
Once this is completed you can say QCTL

07:33.630 --> 07:36.090
get all to see that whatever is present

07:36.090 --> 07:39.120
in your default name space where you help worked other

07:39.120 --> 07:42.540
than Kubernetes default cluster IP stuff

07:42.540 --> 07:44.460
no other thing is available.

07:44.460 --> 07:48.600
So this completes the replica set end to end.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.880
Whatever we have learned using imperative way

07:50.880 --> 07:55.170
just we have used only the AML file for us.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.340
Because Imperatively

07:56.340 --> 07:58.650
you cannot create a replica set object.

07:58.650 --> 08:01.560
Now one thing important here is like one pending

08:01.560 --> 08:03.720
concept is present in Replica set,

08:03.720 --> 08:05.910
which is label send selectors.

08:05.910 --> 08:08.310
So this is going to be a common concept for

08:08.310 --> 08:12.900
multiple Kubernetes concepts, okay?

08:12.900 --> 08:16.020
Like ports, replica sets, deployments

08:16.020 --> 08:17.700
and then services everywhere.

08:17.700 --> 08:20.160
You are going to use labels and selectors.

08:20.160 --> 08:23.370
So we are going to cover it when we are writing equivalent

08:23.370 --> 08:26.077
YAML files there so that we'll understand in detail.

08:26.077 --> 08:28.500
With that said, in our next lecture

08:28.500 --> 08:32.340
we'll start working on the deployment concept of Kubernetes.

08:32.340 --> 08:34.050
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

08:34.050 --> 08:35.310
Until then, bye bye.

08:35.310 --> 08:36.143
Thank you.
