00:00.000 --> 00:01.260
Speaker: Welcome back.

00:01.260 --> 00:03.990
In this step, we are going to update our application

00:03.990 --> 00:07.140
from V2 to V3, using the kubectl

00:07.140 --> 00:08.790
edit deployment option.

00:08.790 --> 00:10.830
So this is very important option.

00:10.830 --> 00:12.420
And then this is the option

00:12.420 --> 00:13.710
we are going to use

00:13.710 --> 00:14.760
in real time.

00:14.760 --> 00:16.170
Most of the time, whenever,

00:16.170 --> 00:17.070
running deployments

00:17.070 --> 00:17.903
we have.

00:17.903 --> 00:19.380
So Kubectl, edit,

00:19.380 --> 00:21.960
deployment, deployment, name

00:21.960 --> 00:23.340
and then we'll go inside

00:23.340 --> 00:24.690
that deployment spec

00:24.690 --> 00:26.220
and then update it.

00:26.220 --> 00:27.240
So that's the reason.

00:27.240 --> 00:28.740
So just look into it.

00:28.740 --> 00:29.700
You see it here.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.539
kubectl, edit, deployment,

00:31.539 --> 00:32.640
and then space.

00:32.640 --> 00:33.573
My first deployment means

00:33.573 --> 00:34.830
like deployment name

00:34.830 --> 00:36.180
or slash whatever it is.

00:36.180 --> 00:38.125
Okay, so and then you are going to go

00:38.125 --> 00:41.760
to container spec dot container start image

00:41.760 --> 00:43.740
and change your image version

00:43.740 --> 00:48.210
from 2 dot 0. 0. 2. 3. 0. 0.

00:48.210 --> 00:50.520
So let's go ahead and then do that now.

00:50.520 --> 00:51.353
So whenever you are doing it,

00:51.353 --> 00:52.186
you can even say that you

00:52.186 --> 00:54.328
if you want to save the version history

00:54.328 --> 00:56.430
you can say that hyphen iPhone

00:56.430 --> 00:58.740
record is equal to true.

00:58.740 --> 01:00.480
So let's go here.

01:00.480 --> 01:02.730
And so I can even say

01:02.730 --> 01:05.695
kubectl edit deployment,

01:05.695 --> 01:09.300
my first deployment and it is

01:09.300 --> 01:12.570
nothing but hyphen iphone.

01:12.570 --> 01:15.153
Record is equal to true.

01:17.880 --> 01:18.713
Right?

01:18.713 --> 01:20.490
And I'm going to go at the end

01:20.490 --> 01:23.400
which is nothing but escape shift G.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.350
And I'll go up and

01:25.350 --> 01:28.980
if you see this is the spec dot container start image.

01:28.980 --> 01:32.640
So I am going to change from 2 to 3 here.

01:32.640 --> 01:36.180
Three zero two zero and I'm going to save it.

01:36.180 --> 01:39.450
Escape : W, Q, right?

01:39.450 --> 01:43.110
So now deployment got edited,

01:43.110 --> 01:43.943
right?

01:43.943 --> 01:44.776
So if you want

01:44.776 --> 01:45.609
you can see that rollout

01:45.609 --> 01:46.500
history one more time.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.630
Okay, so maybe I am delayed.

01:48.630 --> 01:51.180
So it might have already got completed.

01:51.180 --> 01:52.847
Okay, so it already rolled out.

01:52.847 --> 01:54.840
So if you see the ports again,

01:54.840 --> 01:57.540
all the ports will be terminated and then recreated.

01:57.540 --> 02:00.093
See all these are 15 seconds only.

02:00.990 --> 02:02.790
Started just 15 seconds

02:02.790 --> 02:04.770
before our 20 seconds before.

02:04.770 --> 02:06.000
So that's a good thing.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.430
So now if you see one more observation here,

02:08.430 --> 02:10.410
is so one more time you have edited

02:10.410 --> 02:12.420
one more Replica set means

02:12.420 --> 02:13.920
like this is one more deployment.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.810
So you are one more replica

02:15.810 --> 02:16.920
set you'll be able to see

02:16.920 --> 02:18.420
for your third version.

02:18.420 --> 02:20.670
So let's go ahead and then see that

02:20.670 --> 02:21.503
now.

02:21.503 --> 02:23.550
QCT get RS,

02:23.550 --> 02:24.383
right?

02:24.383 --> 02:26.460
And CT get ports.

02:26.460 --> 02:29.430
So you can verify the hashtag here, right?

02:29.430 --> 02:30.320
So, which is nothing,

02:30.320 --> 02:31.903
but this is the one current live one

02:31.903 --> 02:34.950
which is nothing but three two 0 0 version

02:34.950 --> 02:36.150
and 7 7 4 B.

02:36.150 --> 02:39.300
And for our ports also you can see 7 7 4 B

02:39.300 --> 02:41.190
as the hash label, right?

02:41.190 --> 02:42.450
So that's about it.

02:42.450 --> 02:44.400
So now the next thing is rollout history.

02:44.400 --> 02:47.490
So let's see that rollout history of our thing

02:47.490 --> 02:50.340
and it should be version three,

02:50.340 --> 02:51.173
right?

02:52.020 --> 02:54.180
So this is the one we have done in version three

02:54.180 --> 02:56.760
and then that is what we are seeing it now.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.650
So finally, whenever we access the

02:58.650 --> 02:59.730
application,

02:59.730 --> 03:00.563
right,

03:00.563 --> 03:01.860
So we should see version three.

03:01.860 --> 03:04.680
Currently it is V2 here and

03:04.680 --> 03:06.270
if you want I can make it bigger.

03:06.270 --> 03:10.200
Yeah. And if I refresh it should be V3, see, Right?

03:10.200 --> 03:13.290
So now the application version is V3.

03:13.290 --> 03:15.720
So this complete server,

03:15.720 --> 03:16.553
two options

03:16.553 --> 03:19.470
whatever we have available using the imperative way to

03:19.470 --> 03:22.680
update our deployments, we have completed.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.831
So in our next lecture we are going to focus

03:24.831 --> 03:28.410
on roll back deployments.

03:28.410 --> 03:30.210
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.590
Until then, bye bye.

03:31.590 --> 03:32.423
Thank you.
