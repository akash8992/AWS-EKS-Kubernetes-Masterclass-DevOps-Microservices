00:00.150 --> 00:00.983
-: Welcome back.

00:00.983 --> 00:01.830
In this lecture,

00:01.830 --> 00:04.770
we are going to interact with our pod

00:04.770 --> 00:06.930
so we can get the pod logs

00:06.930 --> 00:10.410
and then view the pod logs or stream our pod logs

00:10.410 --> 00:13.560
and even we can connect to our container inside the pod.

00:13.560 --> 00:16.080
All those things we are going to do now.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.450
So let's start with the pods now.

00:18.450 --> 00:22.770
So we can dump our pod logs using Cube CTL logs

00:22.770 --> 00:24.660
and our pod name.

00:24.660 --> 00:29.640
So, and even we can stream the pod logs using -F.

00:29.640 --> 00:32.340
So let's see both of these things now.

00:32.340 --> 00:35.580
So we already have our My First Pod here

00:35.580 --> 00:38.160
so let me paste it.

00:38.160 --> 00:41.490
And Cube CTL logs My First Pod.

00:41.490 --> 00:45.120
And it dumped all the pod logs here, which is nothing but

00:45.120 --> 00:47.340
we are going to access the root context

00:47.340 --> 00:49.380
in our EngineX application

00:49.380 --> 00:51.750
and then it is serving the content.

00:51.750 --> 00:55.753
So now let me do Cube CTL logs -F.

00:57.240 --> 00:59.643
So to stream the logs, right?

01:00.510 --> 01:02.043
My First Pod.

01:03.210 --> 01:08.160
So now we have the logs here so I'm just entering

01:08.160 --> 01:10.020
and then I'll try to access something

01:10.020 --> 01:12.030
and then our logs should come here.

01:12.030 --> 01:17.030
So let me go here and then say enter, and we got it, right?

01:18.060 --> 01:19.590
So this is one more.

01:19.590 --> 01:24.590
And I will say /index.html and then access it, right?

01:27.510 --> 01:29.550
So we got it, we can see it, right?

01:29.550 --> 01:31.500
So /index.html.

01:31.500 --> 01:35.130
So we can even stream our logs using -F command.

01:35.130 --> 01:39.720
So let me type Control C and go back here.

01:39.720 --> 01:42.000
And that's about the pod logs.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.550
In addition to that, you can refer this link

01:44.550 --> 01:47.940
for Cube CTL cheat sheet where you'll have lots of

01:47.940 --> 01:50.370
lots of commands for your understanding.

01:50.370 --> 01:55.050
Mainly Cube CTL logs and then logs related options, right?

01:55.050 --> 01:59.190
So if you see here, Cube CTL logs, right?

01:59.190 --> 02:01.620
So there will be multiple options available here

02:01.620 --> 02:03.420
to interact with our pods.

02:03.420 --> 02:06.420
So with the -L or -F or with -C,

02:06.420 --> 02:08.280
which means if we have multiple containers

02:08.280 --> 02:11.310
and then specific container logs if you want then,

02:11.310 --> 02:12.990
we can even provide the -C

02:12.990 --> 02:15.450
and the container name to get that respective

02:15.450 --> 02:16.500
container logs.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.300
So all these things we can see

02:18.300 --> 02:20.730
and then all these are important commands for us

02:20.730 --> 02:24.720
when we are troubleshooting our issues on the application.

02:24.720 --> 02:26.100
Whenever we deploy applications

02:26.100 --> 02:27.930
and there are issues to troubleshoot,

02:27.930 --> 02:30.540
all these will be very helpful for us.

02:30.540 --> 02:34.020
So now the next thing is to go and then connect to our pod.

02:34.020 --> 02:38.610
So let's do that using Cube CTL exit command, okay?

02:38.610 --> 02:41.910
So using this command, Cube CTL exit -IT

02:41.910 --> 02:44.310
and then pod name and then --.

02:44.310 --> 02:47.910
Ours is a Bash, so we will go and then access it,

02:47.910 --> 02:51.090
which means my container is using Bash.

02:51.090 --> 02:52.740
So let's access it.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.770
And now I will be in my container.

02:55.770 --> 02:57.630
So it is in my My First Pod.

02:57.630 --> 02:58.680
So you can see here,

02:58.680 --> 03:01.530
I am in my My First Pod in my container.

03:01.530 --> 03:05.250
So I can say LS and then I can type the commands.

03:05.250 --> 03:10.250
I can go to USR share EngineX HTML and then I can say

03:11.100 --> 03:13.320
I'll have my index.html here,

03:13.320 --> 03:15.690
I can say CAT index.html.

03:15.690 --> 03:16.980
You can see the same content

03:16.980 --> 03:20.100
whatever you have seen on the browser right here.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.470
Welcome to Stack Simplify Fundamentals and More

03:22.470 --> 03:25.590
and then application V1, the same thing you are seeing.

03:25.590 --> 03:28.770
So you from, again, if you want to exit your container,

03:28.770 --> 03:32.490
say exit, and then you are back to my MacBook Pro

03:32.490 --> 03:34.530
which is your Cube CTL area.

03:34.530 --> 03:37.770
So now that's about connecting to the containers.

03:37.770 --> 03:40.110
And you can even instead of connecting

03:40.110 --> 03:42.120
and then going inside and running it,

03:42.120 --> 03:44.670
so you can directly run outside itself,

03:44.670 --> 03:46.530
which means from your Cube CTL itself,

03:46.530 --> 03:48.420
you can add the command and then run it.

03:48.420 --> 03:52.170
So Cube CTL exec -IT and your pod name

03:52.170 --> 03:54.600
and the command you want to run inside your

03:54.600 --> 03:57.870
respective container is ENV or LS or CAT,

03:57.870 --> 04:00.600
all these things directly you can run here.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.310
So let's run it and then see.

04:02.310 --> 04:05.520
It will paste the environmental variable of our

04:05.520 --> 04:07.260
respective container.

04:07.260 --> 04:08.820
So you can see Kubernetes service pod

04:08.820 --> 04:10.320
and then Kubernetes pod,

04:10.320 --> 04:13.230
all these information from our container we are getting.

04:13.230 --> 04:14.063
In the same way,

04:14.063 --> 04:16.350
you can do LS or you can do CAT.

04:16.350 --> 04:19.230
Again, we'll do index.html CAT for us.

04:19.230 --> 04:21.753
So let's do that now.

04:24.600 --> 04:29.190
So we got the output Kubernetes fundamentals demo.

04:29.190 --> 04:32.400
And the next step is to get the YAML output of a pod

04:32.400 --> 04:33.720
and a service.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.480
So just to see our YAML definition,

04:36.480 --> 04:39.690
so we can even use Cube CTL get pod and the pod name

04:39.690 --> 04:42.123
and then -O YAML instead of -O Wide,

04:42.123 --> 04:45.150
what what we are doing, now you can say YAML

04:45.150 --> 04:49.357
so that we'll get the YAML definition of our respective pod.

04:50.850 --> 04:54.240
So all this it provides in the YAML format.

04:54.240 --> 04:57.440
In the same way, you can do the same for your service.

04:57.440 --> 05:01.680
So you can copy and then past it here.

05:01.680 --> 05:02.513
Okay.

05:03.360 --> 05:04.380
So that's all.

05:04.380 --> 05:09.000
So now, this completes the interacting with pod

05:09.000 --> 05:11.040
and then getting the information about our pod

05:11.040 --> 05:11.873
and all those things.

05:11.873 --> 05:14.850
So now you can see here in our YAML definition for service,

05:14.850 --> 05:18.510
one important thing is see the node pod is 31084

05:18.510 --> 05:22.440
and the pod is 80 and the target pod is 80.

05:22.440 --> 05:25.260
So now you can even try for service three,

05:25.260 --> 05:27.810
whatever we have created, right?

05:27.810 --> 05:31.350
So node pod is 31961 and pod is 81,

05:31.350 --> 05:33.810
which is nothing but your service pod is 81

05:33.810 --> 05:37.410
and your target pod which is your container pod is 80.

05:37.410 --> 05:39.180
So that's about the information

05:39.180 --> 05:41.430
about the pods and your service.

05:41.430 --> 05:45.480
You can see in the YAML definition, whatever it has created.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.610
So now in our next lecture,

05:47.610 --> 05:49.200
we'll move on with the cleaning up

05:49.200 --> 05:50.610
whatever we have created.

05:50.610 --> 05:52.350
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

05:52.350 --> 05:53.550
Until then, bye bye.

05:53.550 --> 05:54.383
Thank you.
