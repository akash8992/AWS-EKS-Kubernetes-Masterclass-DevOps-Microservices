00:00.270 --> 00:01.103
-: Welcome back.

00:01.103 --> 00:01.936
In this step,

00:01.936 --> 00:03.690
whatever the objects we have created,

00:03.690 --> 00:05.490
we are going to delete them.

00:05.490 --> 00:08.250
So using kubectl delete, we can delete them.

00:08.250 --> 00:10.410
And using kubectl get all,

00:10.410 --> 00:11.790
we can get all the objects

00:11.790 --> 00:15.180
present in the default namespace, right?

00:15.180 --> 00:16.590
So I'll say

00:16.590 --> 00:17.850
kubectl

00:17.850 --> 00:18.900
get all.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.030
So which will provide all the objects present

00:21.030 --> 00:22.920
in the default namespace.

00:22.920 --> 00:23.753
So which is nothing,

00:23.753 --> 00:26.190
but I have my part, my first part.

00:26.190 --> 00:28.530
And I also have the service my first service,

00:28.530 --> 00:29.490
my first service two,

00:29.490 --> 00:32.430
and then my first service three, right?

00:32.430 --> 00:35.550
So now let's go ahead and then delete one after the other.

00:35.550 --> 00:36.810
Kubectl

00:36.810 --> 00:37.920
delete

00:37.920 --> 00:39.270
and then pod

00:39.270 --> 00:41.400
and then pod name is

00:41.400 --> 00:43.020
my first pod.

00:43.020 --> 00:44.230
So I can type it

00:45.120 --> 00:46.020
and my

00:46.020 --> 00:47.940
pod got deleted.

00:47.940 --> 00:48.780
In the same way,

00:48.780 --> 00:50.710
we can go ahead and then delete

00:53.430 --> 00:55.410
services, svc,

00:55.410 --> 00:56.243
and

00:57.090 --> 00:59.373
my first service,

01:02.958 --> 01:03.791
and two,

01:05.130 --> 01:06.243
and then three.

01:07.590 --> 01:10.740
So now if you say kubectl get all,

01:10.740 --> 01:14.130
you'll only see plus try p service of Kubernetes.

01:14.130 --> 01:16.680
Rest all got deleted.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.930
So that's about the cleanup.

01:18.930 --> 01:22.620
So I'll see you in the next lecture with the ReplicaSets.

01:22.620 --> 01:24.090
Until then, bye bye.

01:24.090 --> 01:24.923
Thank you.
