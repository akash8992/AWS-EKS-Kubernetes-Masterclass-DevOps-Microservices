00:00.330 --> 00:01.163
-: Welcome back.

00:01.163 --> 00:03.600
In this lecture we are going to learn

00:03.600 --> 00:05.878
about rolling back a deployment.

00:05.878 --> 00:08.853
So we are going to go into 0403,

00:10.080 --> 00:12.570
and we can do this in two ways.

00:12.570 --> 00:15.720
One is roll back to the exact previous version,

00:15.720 --> 00:17.970
whatever we have just now updated,

00:17.970 --> 00:22.350
or we can go to the specific version of the rollback.

00:22.350 --> 00:24.960
So we can do that in both ways.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.940
So in step one we are going to roll back

00:26.940 --> 00:28.260
to a previous version.

00:28.260 --> 00:31.710
And in step two we are going to do in a specific version.

00:31.710 --> 00:33.720
So let's start with understanding,

00:33.720 --> 00:35.880
means like let's get the rollout history first,

00:35.880 --> 00:37.830
and then after that we'll go ahead

00:37.830 --> 00:40.140
and then see what we are going to do.

00:40.140 --> 00:44.550
So first thing is Kube CTL rollout history,

00:44.550 --> 00:49.550
right, Kube CTL rollout history and deployment.

00:51.540 --> 00:55.503
And my first deployment.

00:58.440 --> 01:00.570
So we should have the three releases.

01:00.570 --> 01:03.540
One is the default version, whatever we have deployed,

01:03.540 --> 01:08.540
and then we have upgraded it using set image which is 2.0.0.

01:08.850 --> 01:13.380
And later using edit deployment, we went into 3.0.0.

01:13.380 --> 01:15.718
So if we want to see specific version,

01:15.718 --> 01:19.170
what changes happen, we can even see that.

01:19.170 --> 01:23.249
So let's go here and in rollout history provide

01:23.249 --> 01:24.873
the revision numbers.

01:25.830 --> 01:28.680
So even you can say like this, okay,

01:28.680 --> 01:33.210
hyphen, hyphen, revision is equal to one.

01:33.210 --> 01:36.570
So it'll provide in revision one what happened.

01:36.570 --> 01:39.330
So we need to observe the image tag

01:39.330 --> 01:41.310
or annotations present there.

01:41.310 --> 01:44.343
So in this respect to revision one directly,

01:45.203 --> 01:46.724
it is a first deployment.

01:46.724 --> 01:47.557
So we will have only image.

01:47.557 --> 01:51.600
And in this image you can see 1.0.0, in the same way,

01:51.600 --> 01:56.600
for revision two, it is going to be image targets 2.0.0,

01:56.850 --> 01:59.640
and the annotation if you see what is the change cost,

01:59.640 --> 02:01.980
in this annotation you can see Kubernetes.ivo,

02:01.980 --> 02:03.480
and then change course.

02:03.480 --> 02:06.990
And using Kube CTL set image you have changed

02:06.990 --> 02:09.060
your tool 2.0.0.

02:09.060 --> 02:11.460
So like this you can see everything clearly.

02:11.460 --> 02:14.250
So now let's see revision three.

02:14.250 --> 02:17.130
So there also you'll see the annotation and the change cost.

02:17.130 --> 02:19.620
And using Kube CTL edit deployment,

02:19.620 --> 02:23.660
you have changed your image version from 2.0.0 to 3.0.0.

02:25.800 --> 02:29.400
So that's what is the verified changes in each version.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.820
Okay, so now roll back to previous version.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.890
So let's go ahead and then roll back.

02:34.890 --> 02:38.430
So to roll back, we just need to say Kube CTL rollout

02:38.430 --> 02:41.640
undo the deployment, whatever we have done.

02:41.640 --> 02:46.640
So Kube CTL rollout, undo deployment,

02:46.920 --> 02:50.730
and my deployment name is my first deployment.

02:50.730 --> 02:54.270
We can even copy paste or we can even do this way.

02:54.270 --> 02:56.613
So let's execute one more time.

02:57.574 --> 03:01.440
Okay, so the changes got deployed.

03:01.440 --> 03:06.440
So now, which means like from V3 it should go to V2 version.

03:06.480 --> 03:11.250
And so let's see the rollout history one more time, right?

03:11.250 --> 03:14.430
So rollout history and remove that revision.

03:14.430 --> 03:16.140
So that will see all the history.

03:16.140 --> 03:20.760
So it we should have a rollout history for now, right?

03:20.760 --> 03:24.000
So why, because now we have changed it

03:24.000 --> 03:26.820
from three to four, okay?

03:26.820 --> 03:28.740
And the image version from three to two,

03:28.740 --> 03:32.010
which means here earlier you have the revision version two,

03:32.010 --> 03:34.740
you have undo means like you went to that version.

03:34.740 --> 03:35.573
So that's the reason.

03:35.573 --> 03:39.420
Now you got the four with 2.0.0.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.400
So now let's come back here.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.770
So if you roll back, it will go back to revision two,

03:43.770 --> 03:46.200
and its number increases to revision four.

03:46.200 --> 03:50.040
So our revision two number got revision four now, right?

03:50.040 --> 03:53.790
So now if you want you can crosscheck your deployments

03:53.790 --> 03:57.930
and then replicas it, everything we can check now.

03:57.930 --> 04:02.280
So Kube CTL get RS, right?

04:02.280 --> 04:05.014
And it should be using the deployment,

04:05.014 --> 04:08.850
whatever is used earlier for V2 version, okay?

04:08.850 --> 04:11.010
Replicas it and get ports.

04:11.010 --> 04:14.490
All should be deleted and then recreated now.

04:14.490 --> 04:16.770
So within last 76 seconds only.

04:16.770 --> 04:19.830
So all these got recreated, in the same way,

04:19.830 --> 04:22.260
if you want we can access the application,

04:22.260 --> 04:25.140
and then we should see V2 version have our application

04:25.140 --> 04:27.120
because that is what we have rolled back now.

04:27.120 --> 04:28.890
So let's go back here.

04:28.890 --> 04:31.860
And currently it is V3 and then we roll back it

04:31.860 --> 04:35.100
to older version, which is V2, and it should see V2.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.720
So that's the story here.

04:36.720 --> 04:40.380
So now in our next step, we need to move on

04:40.380 --> 04:45.270
with the roll back to specific version.

04:45.270 --> 04:47.280
So let's do that now.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.440
So as usual, you can see your rollout history,

04:49.440 --> 04:51.450
and then we have seen just now that is nothing,

04:51.450 --> 04:53.370
but four is the current version, right?

04:53.370 --> 04:56.190
With the 2.0.0 as the image.

04:56.190 --> 04:59.040
So now I want to roll back to specific version.

04:59.040 --> 05:02.070
And my specific version is going to be version three,

05:02.070 --> 05:05.910
which is nothing, but where I have the 3.0.0

05:05.910 --> 05:08.130
application V3 version, I am having here

05:08.130 --> 05:09.420
in this revision three.

05:09.420 --> 05:13.380
So I'm going to say Kube CTL rollout,

05:13.380 --> 05:16.260
undo deployment, my first deployment,

05:16.260 --> 05:19.110
and then I'm going to give the revision number here

05:19.110 --> 05:22.440
which is nothing but two specific revision.

05:22.440 --> 05:25.129
And my revision number I'm saying is this one, three.

05:25.129 --> 05:29.070
So which has the image 3.0.0.

05:29.070 --> 05:32.073
So I'll save this, right?

05:33.120 --> 05:35.400
And once the changes are done, immediately,

05:35.400 --> 05:38.580
we are going to see it will roll back to that version.

05:38.580 --> 05:41.550
So I'm going to fast check the ports, okay?

05:41.550 --> 05:44.550
And then it is deleting and then recreating it.

05:44.550 --> 05:46.660
And we will go ahead and then get

05:47.884 --> 05:49.800
the rollout history, right?

05:49.800 --> 05:51.690
So we should, three should go away,

05:51.690 --> 05:54.090
and then we should get the same thing as five,

05:54.090 --> 05:55.740
and we got it, right?

05:55.740 --> 05:56.622
So that's the thing.

05:56.622 --> 05:59.850
So now we can access the application,

05:59.850 --> 06:01.500
and we should have the V3 version

06:01.500 --> 06:03.360
of the application because we roll back

06:03.360 --> 06:05.520
to that version, okay?

06:05.520 --> 06:06.570
You can see that.

06:06.570 --> 06:10.053
So that's about the 0403 roll back deployments.

06:13.290 --> 06:16.320
One last thing in this is like if you want to

06:16.320 --> 06:19.140
restart your applications in a rolling restart fashion,

06:19.140 --> 06:21.570
means like all the parts need to be restarted due

06:21.570 --> 06:24.150
to some memory issues or some whatever you have.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.430
And if you want to restart your application,

06:26.430 --> 06:30.000
so you can do a Kube CTL rolling restart.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.510
And in your deployment name, right, deployment space,

06:33.510 --> 06:36.870
deployment name or deployment slash my first deployment.

06:36.870 --> 06:38.913
And it will do the restart.

06:39.750 --> 06:43.620
So once the restart is done, you can say Kube CTL get ports,

06:43.620 --> 06:46.173
and the restart should be happening now, see?

06:47.040 --> 06:51.750
So now if you see here, all restarted,

06:51.750 --> 06:54.180
eight seconds is the age you can see it, right?

06:54.180 --> 06:55.013
13 seconds.

06:55.013 --> 06:57.690
So just know all these things got recreated immediately.

06:57.690 --> 06:58.523
Okay?

06:58.523 --> 07:02.610
So that's about the roll back deployment.

07:02.610 --> 07:04.560
So in our next lecture we'll focus

07:04.560 --> 07:06.720
on pause and resume deployments.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.190
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

07:08.190 --> 07:09.390
Until then, bye bye.

07:09.390 --> 07:10.223
Thank you.
