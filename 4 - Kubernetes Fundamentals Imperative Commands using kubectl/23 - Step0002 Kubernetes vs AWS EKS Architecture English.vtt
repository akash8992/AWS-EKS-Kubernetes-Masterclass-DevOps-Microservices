00:00.000 --> 00:00.930
-: Welcome back.

00:00.930 --> 00:03.060
In this lecture we are going to understand

00:03.060 --> 00:05.130
about EKS cluster architecture

00:05.130 --> 00:08.580
in combination with Kubernetes cluster components.

00:08.580 --> 00:09.413
Okay?

00:09.413 --> 00:11.940
So as usual in EKS control plane,

00:11.940 --> 00:14.190
which is nothing but cluster control plane,

00:14.190 --> 00:16.230
so you'll have the master node.

00:16.230 --> 00:19.470
Same as our regular Kubernetes cluster.

00:19.470 --> 00:21.211
So we'll have the container runtime,

00:21.211 --> 00:23.760
Kube APA server, headsets, Kube scheduler,

00:23.760 --> 00:26.190
and here it is going to be Kube control manager.

00:26.190 --> 00:28.530
And in addition to that, we are also going

00:28.530 --> 00:31.560
to have something called Fargate control manager

00:31.560 --> 00:35.670
and then Fargate related scheduler also will be available

00:35.670 --> 00:36.870
as part of that.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.420
So which we'll schedule the Fargate ports on,

00:39.420 --> 00:41.793
serverless Fargate, infrastructure in AWS.

00:42.990 --> 00:44.490
So in addition to that,

00:44.490 --> 00:47.400
if you see there we have the worker nodes.

00:47.400 --> 00:51.420
And here you can say it has EKS manager node groups.

00:51.420 --> 00:54.660
So under this we are going to anyway have worker nodes only

00:54.660 --> 00:56.490
and the container runtime kubelet

00:56.490 --> 00:58.950
and then Kube-proxy here common everywhere.

00:58.950 --> 01:00.750
So now what is differing here?

01:00.750 --> 01:02.070
Okay, so it means like you have

01:02.070 --> 01:03.990
the EKS cluster control plane

01:03.990 --> 01:06.090
and the EKS manager node groups

01:06.090 --> 01:08.790
and on regular on-premise Kubernetes also

01:08.790 --> 01:09.720
we have all of these things.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.190
It means like the master components

01:11.190 --> 01:12.870
and then worker components.

01:12.870 --> 01:15.843
So what happens in EKSs?

01:17.100 --> 01:21.540
EKS lets us focus only on our application workloads.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.160
So we don't need to worry

01:23.160 --> 01:25.440
about any of these components.

01:25.440 --> 01:28.200
Either it is exit high availability,

01:28.200 --> 01:30.000
our kube scheduler part,

01:30.000 --> 01:31.470
our kube API server part,

01:31.470 --> 01:33.900
our disrespect to enter what is present

01:33.900 --> 01:37.020
in these blue boxes is not our job.

01:37.020 --> 01:40.890
Our core focus will be how to design our applications

01:40.890 --> 01:43.080
and then how to deploy those applications

01:43.080 --> 01:46.680
into Kubernetes cluster

01:46.680 --> 01:49.980
and its node groups available in AWS.

01:49.980 --> 01:52.830
So which means, so we really don't need to worry

01:52.830 --> 01:55.920
about the high availability or the maintenance

01:55.920 --> 01:59.400
or anything about these master worker nodes.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.476
So once we create and then create the cluster auto scaler

02:02.476 --> 02:05.790
for our EKS, our job is done.

02:05.790 --> 02:07.680
So the rest end-to-end maintenance

02:07.680 --> 02:09.990
of all of these components

02:09.990 --> 02:12.510
will be the responsibility of the AWS.

02:12.510 --> 02:17.510
So that's about the EKS specialty.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.200
So with that said, we'll move

02:19.200 --> 02:22.530
on with our next steps in our upcoming lectures.

02:22.530 --> 02:24.180
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

02:24.180 --> 02:25.410
Until then, bye-bye.

02:25.410 --> 02:26.243
Thank you.
