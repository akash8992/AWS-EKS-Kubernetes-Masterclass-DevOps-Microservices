00:00.120 --> 00:00.953
-: Welcome back.

00:00.953 --> 00:01.786
In this lecture,

00:01.786 --> 00:04.260
we are looking into the ReplicaSets demo.

00:04.260 --> 00:06.240
So let's check into it, okay?

00:06.240 --> 00:08.060
So we are in our Kubernetes Fundamental

00:08.060 --> 00:11.970
03-ReplicaSets-with-kubectl section,

00:11.970 --> 00:14.940
and we completed the Step 01 introduction just now.

00:14.940 --> 00:18.180
And then we are moving into the Creating ReplicaSets.

00:18.180 --> 00:20.130
So one important thing about ReplicaSet

00:20.130 --> 00:22.350
is we really don't have a imperative command

00:22.350 --> 00:23.940
to create a ReplicaSet.

00:23.940 --> 00:27.420
So we need to definitely define our YAML Manifest, okay?

00:27.420 --> 00:29.910
So here, we are going to only look into

00:29.910 --> 00:33.300
whatever is required inside, in this YAML Manifest,

00:33.300 --> 00:35.280
and then, more than that,

00:35.280 --> 00:36.750
other things we are going to discuss

00:36.750 --> 00:38.340
when we are going to write the YAML,

00:38.340 --> 00:40.020
once we learn the YAML fundamentals,

00:40.020 --> 00:41.520
and then all those things.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.530
So for us, if you see here,

00:43.530 --> 00:45.720
apiVersion is /apps/v1,

00:45.720 --> 00:47.370
and the kind is ReplicaSet,

00:47.370 --> 00:48.360
which we are going to create.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.340
It means like the object which we are going to create

00:50.340 --> 00:52.583
in Kubernetes is ReplicaSet.

00:52.583 --> 00:57.150
And the ReplicaSet name is my-helloworld-rs.

00:57.150 --> 01:00.150
So that's the ReplicaSet name.

01:00.150 --> 01:01.350
And in addition to that,

01:01.350 --> 01:03.750
number of replicas means like number of pods

01:03.750 --> 01:06.480
it need to get created is three pods, okay?

01:06.480 --> 01:09.510
Forget about labels and these selectors

01:09.510 --> 01:11.460
and these labels, all these things.

01:11.460 --> 01:13.080
Let's forget about it for now.

01:13.080 --> 01:16.740
We'll see when we are writing YAML definitions, okay?

01:16.740 --> 01:19.350
So now, replicas is 3 replicas.

01:19.350 --> 01:21.570
And the next is container spec, right?

01:21.570 --> 01:24.150
So name of the container is my-helloworld-app,

01:24.150 --> 01:29.150
and my image is stacksimplify/kube-helloworld:1.0.0.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.650
So this is the application.

01:31.650 --> 01:35.670
So let's go ahead and then create it using kubectl create

01:35.670 --> 01:39.367
and then file name is replicaset-demo.yml.

01:40.230 --> 01:43.440
So let's go ahead and then create it now.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.020
So if you fork this respective directory,

01:46.020 --> 01:48.750
which is nothing but this Kubernetes Fundamentals,

01:48.750 --> 01:49.890
fork our download,

01:49.890 --> 01:54.210
fork and then download our download to your local repo.

01:54.210 --> 01:58.410
And you need to just go into 03-ReplicaSets-with-kubectl,

01:58.410 --> 02:02.790
and you'll find this replicaset-demo.yml file here, right?

02:02.790 --> 02:04.770
So I'll go into that now.

02:04.770 --> 02:07.950
So if you see here, in Kubernetes Fundamentals,

02:07.950 --> 02:10.110
I'm going to 03-ReplicaSets.

02:10.110 --> 02:12.150
And I can find the file here.

02:12.150 --> 02:17.150
So I'm saying kubectl create -f and replicasets-demo.yml.

02:21.630 --> 02:24.240
My ReplicaSet is getting created.

02:24.240 --> 02:29.240
So now, the next thing is to list the ReplicaSet, right?

02:29.970 --> 02:34.350
So you can say kubectl get replicaset,

02:34.350 --> 02:35.490
and it will be listed.

02:35.490 --> 02:36.900
my-helloworld-rs.

02:36.900 --> 02:39.360
You can see here, desired number of replicas are 3,

02:39.360 --> 02:41.970
whatever we have configured here.

02:41.970 --> 02:43.590
And the current is 3,

02:43.590 --> 02:46.110
and then release 3, okay?

02:46.110 --> 02:50.790
So now, the alias for ReplicaSets is kubectl get rs.

02:50.790 --> 02:54.150
Even you can use rs, if you want to, right?

02:54.150 --> 02:57.906
So, and the next thing is to describe the ReplicaSet.

02:57.906 --> 03:01.830
Kubectl describe and rs.

03:01.830 --> 03:03.960
rs is alias of ReplicaSet.

03:03.960 --> 03:08.100
And my ReplicaSet name is my-helloworld-rs.

03:08.100 --> 03:12.090
So let's describe the ReplicaSet, right?

03:12.090 --> 03:15.030
So now if you see, in this ReplicaSet,

03:15.030 --> 03:17.340
so let's go here,

03:17.340 --> 03:20.760
and we can see all the information, okay?

03:20.760 --> 03:24.480
So successfully created the ReplicaSet controller for,

03:24.480 --> 03:26.430
and it created three pods here, okay?

03:26.430 --> 03:27.390
So, for all the pods,

03:27.390 --> 03:30.690
it doesn't have any issue in creating it.

03:30.690 --> 03:33.690
So now let's list the pods.

03:33.690 --> 03:36.753
So kubectl get pods.

03:38.820 --> 03:40.440
So now we have three pods.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.450
Means like three replicas got created,

03:42.450 --> 03:46.020
my-helloworld-rs and some dynamic name, right?

03:46.020 --> 03:47.610
So in the same way,

03:47.610 --> 03:50.530
we can even list the pods with

03:52.890 --> 03:53.880
wide option,

03:53.880 --> 03:58.880
so that we know on which nodes these pods were scheduled.

03:58.950 --> 04:01.440
So on 118, we have one pod scheduled.

04:01.440 --> 04:05.040
On 145, we have two pods scheduled.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.690
So in addition to that,

04:06.690 --> 04:09.930
if you want to verify the owner of the pod, right?

04:09.930 --> 04:14.130
So we can give the kubectl get pods and then pod name

04:14.130 --> 04:16.110
and then -o and then yaml.

04:16.110 --> 04:17.430
Get that YAML output,

04:17.430 --> 04:20.580
and inside that, when you refer the ownerReferences,

04:20.580 --> 04:22.470
you'll get those details.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.860
So kubectl get pods

04:25.860 --> 04:28.920
and then any one of the pod names.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.373
So we'll get the ReplicaSet as the owner.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.190
Right?

04:38.190 --> 04:39.880
So if you go up

04:41.340 --> 04:42.260
and...

04:45.000 --> 04:46.800
We can see here, right?

04:46.800 --> 04:48.800
So ownerReferences.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.670
We can see the name tag here,

04:50.670 --> 04:52.860
which is nothing but my-helloworld-rs,

04:52.860 --> 04:55.170
which is nothing but the ReplicaSet.

04:55.170 --> 04:56.343
So in simple terms,

04:57.210 --> 04:58.800
to whom this pod belongs to

04:58.800 --> 05:00.000
is nothing but this pod

05:00.000 --> 05:02.610
belongs to that respective ReplicaSet.

05:02.610 --> 05:05.610
So that you can find using ownerReferences.

05:05.610 --> 05:07.050
So now in our next step,

05:07.050 --> 05:12.050
we'll focus on exposing this as a ReplicaSet as a service.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.100
I'll see you in the next lecture.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.877
Until then, bye bye. Thank you.
