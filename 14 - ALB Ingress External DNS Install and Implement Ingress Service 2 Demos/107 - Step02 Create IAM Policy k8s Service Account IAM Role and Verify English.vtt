00:00.360 --> 00:01.650
-: Welcome back.

00:01.650 --> 00:04.770
Let's go back to our GitHub repository and enter

00:04.770 --> 00:09.770
into the section 0 8 0 6 deploy external DNS on EKS.

00:09.930 --> 00:12.810
And as part of step zero one introduction,

00:12.810 --> 00:15.780
we already know what we are going to implement

00:15.780 --> 00:18.180
as part of this external DNS.

00:18.180 --> 00:20.400
So let's go to our step two here

00:20.400 --> 00:23.760
which is create IAM policy.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.890
So this IAM policy will allow

00:25.890 --> 00:27.570
external DNS part to

00:27.570 --> 00:31.810
add, remove DNS entries are record sets in hosted zone in

00:31.810 --> 00:33.870
AWS Route 53 service.

00:33.870 --> 00:37.080
So let's go to AWS management console and go

00:37.080 --> 00:39.570
to IAM service

00:39.570 --> 00:42.120
and go to policies here

00:42.120 --> 00:46.710
and click on create a policy and go to the Jason tab

00:46.710 --> 00:49.650
and in the visual editor add this policy, right?

00:49.650 --> 00:51.930
So whatever the policy here it is there,

00:51.930 --> 00:54.810
add it and then name the policy

00:54.810 --> 00:58.800
as allow external updates and then create that policy.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.170
So click on policies

01:01.170 --> 01:05.823
and create a policy and go to the Jason tab.

01:07.639 --> 01:09.780
And so let me remove this

01:09.780 --> 01:13.083
and go here and add this entire thing.

01:14.280 --> 01:18.270
Copy and paste it, right?

01:18.270 --> 01:20.340
And go to the visual editor tab.

01:20.340 --> 01:23.820
And you can see here it will be like Route 53.

01:23.820 --> 01:27.450
And Route 53 change resource record sets is one thing

01:27.450 --> 01:30.210
inside the hosted zone, any hosted zone.

01:30.210 --> 01:34.200
And in route 53 you have something called list hosted zones

01:34.200 --> 01:36.120
and list resource record sets.

01:36.120 --> 01:39.270
So these are the permissions we have given currently.

01:39.270 --> 01:44.270
So let me minimize this and click on next and no tags.

01:45.060 --> 01:47.100
So we'll provide the name here.

01:47.100 --> 01:48.363
So the name here is,

01:49.320 --> 01:53.040
allow external DNS updates

01:53.040 --> 01:55.920
and allow access to Route 53 resources

01:55.920 --> 01:59.730
for external DNS is the description.

01:59.730 --> 02:02.490
And click on create the policy.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.590
So once the policy is created

02:04.590 --> 02:06.380
we'll move on to the next step, right?

02:06.380 --> 02:09.060
So we'll make a note of the policy ARN.

02:09.060 --> 02:10.980
So in your case it is going to be different

02:10.980 --> 02:14.550
because your AWS account ID will be present here.

02:14.550 --> 02:17.640
Maybe the name might be same but your AWS account

02:17.640 --> 02:19.230
ID will be different here.

02:19.230 --> 02:22.500
So this is allow external DNS updates and

02:22.500 --> 02:26.880
from here you can take the ARN and then make a note of it.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.680
So this is the ARN,

02:28.680 --> 02:30.810
we need to make a note of.

02:30.810 --> 02:33.840
And now in step zero three we are going to create

02:33.840 --> 02:37.740
a IAM role Kubernetes service account and associate that

02:37.740 --> 02:39.240
IAM policy.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.440
All these things, right?

02:40.440 --> 02:44.310
Creating a IAM role and annotate that IAM role inside

02:44.310 --> 02:47.610
this Kubernetes service account and also associate

02:47.610 --> 02:49.470
IAM policy to IAM role.

02:49.470 --> 02:52.890
So all these things can be done using one command in

02:52.890 --> 02:55.800
eksctl CLI, right?

02:55.800 --> 02:57.716
So that is called EKS CTL

02:57.716 --> 03:00.720
create IAM service account.

03:00.720 --> 03:05.100
So using this IAM is nothing but creating a IAM role.

03:05.100 --> 03:06.930
And in this part service account is nothing

03:06.930 --> 03:09.210
but Kubernetes service account.

03:09.210 --> 03:10.710
So IAM service account,

03:10.710 --> 03:11.820
what it does is,

03:11.820 --> 03:13.980
so it'll create a Kubernetes

03:13.980 --> 03:17.820
service account named external DNS and also it

03:17.820 --> 03:21.990
creates a AWS IAM role and also associates them

03:21.990 --> 03:25.620
by annotating a role ARN in service account.

03:25.620 --> 03:28.470
So this external DNS service account will be

03:28.470 --> 03:32.580
annotated with the IAM role it is going to create.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.290
And in addition to that the

03:34.290 --> 03:36.270
allow external DNS updates

03:36.270 --> 03:39.990
IAM policy whatever we have created in step two.

03:39.990 --> 03:43.080
So that one will be associated to the IAM role,

03:43.080 --> 03:44.820
it is going to create.

03:44.820 --> 03:46.350
Accordingly you can see here

03:46.350 --> 03:49.903
eksctl create IAM service account,

03:49.903 --> 03:52.620
a name of the service account you need to provide

03:52.620 --> 03:56.640
and in which name space in the Kubernetes this

03:56.640 --> 03:59.220
service account should be created so far as it

03:59.220 --> 04:02.490
is going to be in the default name space, right?

04:02.490 --> 04:05.310
So the default name space and the cluster, right?

04:05.310 --> 04:09.690
The name of your EKS cluster and also the policy,

04:09.690 --> 04:11.850
IAM policy that need to be attached.

04:11.850 --> 04:13.050
IAM policy ARN

04:13.050 --> 04:16.410
and whatever we have made a note here and we are going to

04:16.410 --> 04:18.990
approve and override any existing service

04:18.990 --> 04:21.510
accounts with the same name, right?

04:21.510 --> 04:22.560
So this is the command,

04:22.560 --> 04:24.810
it replays the name external

04:24.810 --> 04:27.870
DNS will be the name of my service account

04:27.870 --> 04:29.370
and name space it is going to be

04:29.370 --> 04:30.387
default name space

04:30.387 --> 04:33.870
and cluster it is going to be EKS demo one

04:33.870 --> 04:36.090
and IAM policy ARN, right?

04:36.090 --> 04:37.620
So whatever you have took the note

04:37.620 --> 04:40.740
in step two in your case this is going to change

04:40.740 --> 04:41.580
and this,

04:41.580 --> 04:44.880
mainly your AWS account ID will change here.

04:44.880 --> 04:48.690
So we'll place that allow external DNS updates

04:48.690 --> 04:50.250
policy related ARN

04:50.250 --> 04:52.710
and rest approve and override existing service account.

04:52.710 --> 04:54.420
These two are same.

04:54.420 --> 04:59.420
So let me copy this and go here and provide this command.

05:00.540 --> 05:04.980
And this should create the Kubernetes service account

05:04.980 --> 05:09.000
and also it need to create a IAM role for us, right?

05:09.000 --> 05:13.110
So it's getting created, existing account will be updated

05:13.110 --> 05:16.110
as override existing service accounts was set.

05:16.110 --> 05:17.520
So let's wait for it.

05:17.520 --> 05:20.970
It is going to create a cloud format and stack for us.

05:20.970 --> 05:22.080
So this is completely,

05:22.080 --> 05:24.270
eksctl is automated,

05:24.270 --> 05:27.117
means like the CLI is triggering to create a cloud format

05:27.117 --> 05:31.110
and stack for us with the details whatever we have provided.

05:31.110 --> 05:34.350
So let's wait for the service account to get created

05:34.350 --> 05:37.440
and after that we can search for kubectl get

05:37.440 --> 05:41.250
and then SCA is nothing but service account external DNS.

05:41.250 --> 05:42.330
And you should find

05:42.330 --> 05:47.330
that external DNS in our default name space.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.840
So it is created now.

05:48.840 --> 05:51.870
So we'll say kubectl get SCA

05:51.870 --> 05:53.760
it'll list the service accounts present

05:53.760 --> 05:57.030
in your local default name space.

05:57.030 --> 05:58.410
So let's wait for it.

05:58.410 --> 06:00.977
So you can see external DNS related service

06:00.977 --> 06:04.530
account created 11 seconds before, right?

06:04.530 --> 06:07.500
So let me say kubectl

06:07.500 --> 06:09.810
describe SCA

06:09.810 --> 06:14.810
and then you'll say external hyphen DNS, right?

06:14.850 --> 06:15.840
So you are describing

06:15.840 --> 06:19.260
that external DNS related service account and you'll

06:19.260 --> 06:21.390
in the annotations you can find

06:21.390 --> 06:25.590
eks.amazonaws.com/roleARN

06:25.590 --> 06:27.690
and it has a IAM role ARN.

06:27.690 --> 06:28.950
So this IAM role

06:28.950 --> 06:31.350
is created and associated with

06:31.350 --> 06:33.360
this external DNS.

06:33.360 --> 06:37.500
So now let's come back here, right?

06:37.500 --> 06:39.090
And verify,

06:39.090 --> 06:41.463
go to the cloud formation stack and verify.

06:42.744 --> 06:44.770
So let's go to services

06:46.358 --> 06:48.480
and go to cloud formation.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.633
And in cloud formation we'll find this equivalent stack.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.918
So we'll find it here.

06:54.918 --> 06:59.160
Eksctl, EKS demo one add on IAM service account

06:59.160 --> 07:03.510
with in the default name space whose name is external DNS.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.160
So let's open it.

07:05.160 --> 07:08.610
And if you see here in the resources, right?

07:08.610 --> 07:10.560
In the resources section.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.850
So let me close this.

07:11.850 --> 07:13.790
You can see the physical ID,

07:13.790 --> 07:16.680
this is the IAM service account it has created.

07:16.680 --> 07:19.290
So which is nothing but IAM role it has created.

07:19.290 --> 07:21.300
So if you click on this physical ID, right?

07:21.300 --> 07:24.570
It'll take us to the IAM role it has created.

07:24.570 --> 07:28.650
So this is the IAM role it created and this is

07:28.650 --> 07:31.830
the IAM role ARN and we need to make a note of

07:31.830 --> 07:33.270
this role ARN.

07:33.270 --> 07:35.880
Note of this IAM role ARN,

07:35.880 --> 07:36.990
in this approach.

07:36.990 --> 07:41.220
Or we can also get the IAM role using

07:41.220 --> 07:44.160
eksctl get IAM service account

07:44.160 --> 07:46.770
and the cluster name is EKS demo one.

07:46.770 --> 07:50.970
So using this command also we can get the IAM role ARN.

07:50.970 --> 07:54.720
So let's run this command eksctl get IAM service

07:54.720 --> 07:58.530
account and in cluster EKS demo one.

07:58.530 --> 08:02.130
So it should provide us two IAM service accounts.

08:02.130 --> 08:05.610
One we have created for AWS load balancer controller

08:05.610 --> 08:09.360
and one which we recently created, which is external DNS.

08:09.360 --> 08:14.250
And from here also we can make a note of this role ARN.

08:14.250 --> 08:16.110
So why do we need to make a note

08:16.110 --> 08:19.320
of this role ARN is in the next step whenever

08:19.320 --> 08:22.860
we are updating the external DNS related manifest.

08:22.860 --> 08:26.100
So there we need to provide this role ARN.

08:26.100 --> 08:29.730
So that external DNS pod is the reference

08:29.730 --> 08:33.750
for this role ARN from that respective manifest.

08:33.750 --> 08:36.150
So now let's come back here

08:36.150 --> 08:39.240
and in our next step we are going to move to

08:39.240 --> 08:40.800
step zero four to discuss

08:40.800 --> 08:45.120
about our review the external DNS Kubernetes manifest.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.680
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

08:46.680 --> 08:48.513
Until then, bye bye thank you.
