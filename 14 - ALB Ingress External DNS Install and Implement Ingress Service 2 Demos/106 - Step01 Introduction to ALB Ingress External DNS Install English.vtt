00:00.600 --> 00:01.530
-: Welcome back.

00:01.530 --> 00:06.420
In this section, we are going to install the ExternalDNS.

00:06.420 --> 00:09.840
So before going and installing the ExternalDNS

00:09.840 --> 00:13.050
or understanding what all components involved

00:13.050 --> 00:15.450
from ExternalDNS perspective,

00:15.450 --> 00:19.749
let's understand why do we need this ExternalDNS.

00:19.749 --> 00:22.050
In previous SSL demo section

00:22.050 --> 00:26.670
we added AWS Route 53 DNS records manually.

00:26.670 --> 00:30.630
So we went into the Route 53 service inside hosted zones

00:30.630 --> 00:33.810
for that respective domain stack simplified dot com,

00:33.810 --> 00:35.610
we have added a DNS record

00:35.610 --> 00:39.750
SSL demo 101 dot stack simplified dot com.

00:39.750 --> 00:44.220
But with ExternalDNS, we can automatically add it

00:44.220 --> 00:46.590
for a Kubernetes ingress service

00:46.590 --> 00:51.590
or a Kubernetes service by defining it as a annotation.

00:52.200 --> 00:55.260
So if we add this annotation ExternalDNS

00:55.260 --> 00:58.710
dot all four dot Kubernetes dot io slash host name

00:58.710 --> 01:02.460
and your DNS name, something like DNS test 2901

01:02.460 --> 01:03.750
or DNS dot,

01:03.750 --> 01:05.580
DNS abc dot R,

01:05.580 --> 01:08.190
my application dot stack simplified dot com

01:08.190 --> 01:11.430
So if you add these things, then automatically

01:11.430 --> 01:16.247
those records will be added in the AWS Route 53 service

01:17.100 --> 01:20.700
inside the hosted zone as a DNS record.

01:20.700 --> 01:24.840
And in addition to that, you can create, update, delete

01:24.840 --> 01:28.980
these DNS records from ExternalDNS itself.

01:28.980 --> 01:33.167
So let's see what all components involved in the

01:33.167 --> 01:35.050
ExternalDNS related

01:36.330 --> 01:37.163
controller.

01:38.190 --> 01:43.190
So in AWS cloud, we already have the EKS cluster created.

01:43.890 --> 01:47.850
So for ExternalDNS, in the default name space,

01:47.850 --> 01:52.743
we are going to create a ExternalDNS service account.

01:53.580 --> 01:57.420
And this service account, right, will be associated

01:57.420 --> 01:59.190
with the IM role.

01:59.190 --> 02:01.920
So why we need to create this IM role

02:01.920 --> 02:05.340
and what is the things present in the IM policy

02:05.340 --> 02:08.940
about permissions that IM policy is going to have.

02:08.940 --> 02:12.690
So we are going to create a IM policy

02:12.690 --> 02:16.110
wherein in that IM policy, it'll have the permissions

02:16.110 --> 02:20.250
for the AWS Route 53 resource for create, update

02:20.250 --> 02:22.890
and then delete records inside that.

02:22.890 --> 02:27.480
And that IM policy will be associated with this IM role.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.780
And that IM role will be annotated

02:30.780 --> 02:33.900
in this respective service account in Kubernetes

02:33.900 --> 02:37.890
which is nothing but ExternalDNS service account.

02:37.890 --> 02:41.280
And then we will also have the ExternalDNS

02:41.280 --> 02:43.800
related deployments cluster role,

02:43.800 --> 02:47.160
cluster role bindings all related objects

02:47.160 --> 02:50.010
deployed inside this default name space.

02:50.010 --> 02:52.920
So this ExternalDNS deployment will create the

02:52.920 --> 02:55.680
ExternalDNS port for us.

02:55.680 --> 02:58.980
And whenever as a Kubernetes admin,

02:58.980 --> 03:00.700
if we deploy ingress service

03:02.014 --> 03:04.050
or a regular Kubernetes service

03:04.050 --> 03:06.540
with the annotation whatever we have specified

03:06.540 --> 03:08.760
related to ExternalDNS,

03:08.760 --> 03:13.620
so then ExternalDNS goes to the Kubernetes API server

03:13.620 --> 03:17.130
and retrieves a list of resources like

03:17.130 --> 03:19.080
services or ingresses

03:19.080 --> 03:22.170
from the Kubernetes APS server to determine a

03:22.170 --> 03:25.590
desired list of DNS regards that need to be created

03:25.590 --> 03:29.790
or updated or deleted from the AWS Route 53.

03:29.790 --> 03:32.400
So which means this ExternalDNS port will communicate

03:32.400 --> 03:35.460
with this APS server and get a list of the ingress

03:35.460 --> 03:38.700
or regular services and search for the annotation

03:38.700 --> 03:41.430
related to ExternalDNS with the DNS names

03:41.430 --> 03:45.090
and if it finds those DNS names inside those services

03:45.090 --> 03:47.490
are ingress services, so then it'll go ahead

03:47.490 --> 03:49.770
and then create or update or delete

03:49.770 --> 03:52.710
those DNS records in the AWS

03:52.710 --> 03:55.260
Route 53 related service.

03:55.260 --> 03:59.700
So this completes the introductory part of ExternalDNS.

03:59.700 --> 04:01.590
So in our next lecture, we'll go ahead

04:01.590 --> 04:04.170
and then practically implement this demo.

04:04.170 --> 04:05.730
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

04:05.730 --> 04:07.533
Until then, bye bye. Thank you.
