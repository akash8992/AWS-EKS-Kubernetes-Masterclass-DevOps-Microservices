00:00.570 --> 00:02.430
Instructor: Welcome back. In this step,

00:02.430 --> 00:07.380
we are going to update the external DNS Kubernetes manifest.

00:07.380 --> 00:10.110
So let's go to our visual studio code here,

00:10.110 --> 00:15.110
and we are in 0806 deploy external DNS on EKS

00:15.480 --> 00:19.176
and we have the Kubernetes Kube manifest folder.

00:19.176 --> 00:24.176
And inside that we have 01 deploy external DNS.yaml.

00:24.233 --> 00:29.233
And this is the external DNS related Kubernetes manifest.

00:29.576 --> 00:34.326
And inside this, we are going to update the IM role here,

00:35.730 --> 00:38.130
whatever the role we are in we have created.

00:38.130 --> 00:39.810
So we can update it.

00:39.810 --> 00:42.134
So let's go back here.

00:42.134 --> 00:45.450
And so this is the role (indistinct), right?

00:45.450 --> 00:50.450
So let me copy it and come back here and add it here.

00:51.030 --> 00:53.460
And now the next thing, right?

00:53.460 --> 00:55.380
So let's come back here,

00:55.380 --> 00:57.540
and if you see change one line number nine,

00:57.540 --> 00:59.700
IAM role update is completed,

00:59.700 --> 01:02.847
and we'll go to line number 56-- 55 and 56,

01:02.847 --> 01:04.830
and then comment them.

01:04.830 --> 01:09.000
We used EKS CTL to create the IAM role and attach it

01:09.000 --> 01:12.240
the allow external DNS updates policy.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.653
So we didn't use Kiam or kube2iam,

01:15.653 --> 01:19.020
so we didn't need to add these two lines.

01:19.020 --> 01:21.450
So these things are not required here

01:21.450 --> 01:25.380
in line 55 and then 56, right?

01:25.380 --> 01:28.410
So let's come back here. Where is it?

01:28.410 --> 01:30.360
So these things are commented here

01:30.360 --> 01:35.360
because we are not using any Kiam or kube2iam tools here

01:36.120 --> 01:37.740
and now in this, right?

01:37.740 --> 01:41.370
So if you see here, this is the deployment specification.

01:41.370 --> 01:42.960
So if you go top, so this is the

01:42.960 --> 01:46.410
service account related Kubernetes manifest,

01:46.410 --> 01:48.540
and these are related to cluster role,

01:48.540 --> 01:52.440
and then cluster role bindings related external DNS things.

01:52.440 --> 01:55.980
And now here you'll find the external DNS deployment

01:55.980 --> 01:58.380
related Kubernetes manifest.

01:58.380 --> 02:02.730
And inside that in the pod template specification

02:02.730 --> 02:06.060
you are using the service account name as external DNS,

02:06.060 --> 02:09.810
and containers, you are using k8s.gcr.io

02:09.810 --> 02:13.680
So whatever the latest external DNS pod version available...

02:13.680 --> 02:16.020
So, we are taking today, which is as on today

02:16.020 --> 02:18.390
V0.10.2 is the latest.

02:18.390 --> 02:21.540
So we are using this. And, in future, if it changes...

02:21.540 --> 02:24.990
So, you can change the version here accordingly.

02:24.990 --> 02:28.020
And in addition to that as part of change three

02:28.020 --> 02:32.130
if you come back here to the documentation, right?

02:32.130 --> 02:35.400
So line 65 and 67 commented here.

02:35.400 --> 02:36.870
So what exactly that means?

02:36.870 --> 02:38.760
So this is a very important step.

02:38.760 --> 02:42.900
So 65 and 67 were commented and inside those things

02:42.900 --> 02:45.688
you'll find something called domain filter ex.

02:45.688 --> 02:49.470
So if you want to filter your domain, so currently

02:49.470 --> 02:52.440
I remove the domain filter or I commented it

02:52.440 --> 02:56.010
which means this external DNS is applicable

02:56.010 --> 03:01.010
to all the hosted zones available in my AWS Route 53.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.600
So if you go back here

03:03.600 --> 03:08.600
and go to route 53 service here or let me go from here

03:08.970 --> 03:11.178
and go to route 53 and you'll find lot

03:11.178 --> 03:14.550
of domains available here for me in the hosted zones.

03:14.550 --> 03:17.100
So you can see here all Cloud Guru DevOps

03:17.100 --> 03:19.050
in CloudStack simplified Terraform Guru.

03:19.050 --> 03:21.960
So like there are multiple domains available here,

03:21.960 --> 03:24.030
and for all these domains, right?

03:24.030 --> 03:28.837
So this external DNS can update, delete, create,

03:28.837 --> 03:31.590
-: -inside that, the DNS records.

03:31.590 --> 03:34.867
But if you want to do only for specific domains,

03:34.867 --> 03:36.540
-: -so, you can filter those domains

03:36.540 --> 03:38.040
and only provide those domains.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.080
Example, if you want to provide only

03:40.080 --> 03:43.080
for Stacksimplify.com, then you can provide

03:43.080 --> 03:46.020
for Stacksimplify.com like that, okay?

03:46.020 --> 03:47.370
So matching provider domain,

03:47.370 --> 03:52.050
omit it, o-- omit to process all available hosted zones.

03:52.050 --> 03:55.020
So I omitted it or commented it so that it is,

03:55.020 --> 03:58.740
it'll process all the available hosted zones for me.

03:58.740 --> 04:00.840
So I commented it and in the same way,

04:00.840 --> 04:02.550
this is another important setting

04:02.550 --> 04:05.340
which is policy absurd only, right?

04:05.340 --> 04:08.220
If you see here policy absurd only.

04:08.220 --> 04:10.496
So when you enable this, right?

04:10.496 --> 04:13.950
What happens is it'll be able to create the DNS

04:13.950 --> 04:16.500
but it'll not be able to delete the DNS.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.980
So would prevent external DNS from deleting any regards.

04:19.980 --> 04:23.010
So omit to enable full synchronization.

04:23.010 --> 04:25.170
So which means if you commend this

04:25.170 --> 04:29.010
then this path policy absurd only when you comment it

04:29.010 --> 04:32.610
which means whenever you create an ingress service and then

04:32.610 --> 04:36.240
there you have the external DNS annotation related DNS name,

04:36.240 --> 04:38.070
so it'll go ahead and then create it.

04:38.070 --> 04:40.260
So whenever you delete that ingress service,

04:40.260 --> 04:41.880
then automatically the record

04:41.880 --> 04:44.760
inside route 53 also will get deleted.

04:44.760 --> 04:48.030
So for full synchronization, comment this part.

04:48.030 --> 04:50.580
So, accordingly I have commented it, but

04:50.580 --> 04:55.020
if you want the external DNS to only create the DNSs,

04:55.020 --> 04:58.560
but it should not delete them at that point,

04:58.560 --> 05:00.030
un-comment this, right?

05:00.030 --> 05:03.570
And that is not going to be a full synchronization

05:03.570 --> 05:07.773
and AWS zone type, only look at public hosted zones

05:07.773 --> 05:12.060
and valid values are public, private are no value for both.

05:12.060 --> 05:13.777
So these are the things available for us.

05:13.777 --> 05:16.620
-: -additional setting for us. And registry type is txt,

05:16.620 --> 05:21.060
txt owner IDs, my hosted zone, identify some identifier

05:21.060 --> 05:22.290
you can put it.

05:22.290 --> 05:25.230
So these are the things you need to pass to the external DNS

05:25.230 --> 05:28.980
pod as an argument so that it will take those things.

05:28.980 --> 05:31.230
And if you see here, it'll take the source

05:31.230 --> 05:34.080
as a service or a source as a ingress.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.120
So which we have discussed here, right?

05:36.120 --> 05:39.300
So if you go back here and see this, right?

05:39.300 --> 05:42.540
So your source can be, means like, your ingress service.

05:42.540 --> 05:44.820
Y--Your source can be, means like...

05:44.820 --> 05:47.460
the Kubernetes manifest can be a ingress service

05:47.460 --> 05:50.340
or a regular Kubernetes service of type load balancer.

05:50.340 --> 05:53.430
So that what happens is those can go ahead and then

05:53.430 --> 05:57.660
create the route 53 record automatically by external DNS

05:57.660 --> 06:02.340
whenever you provide this respective annotation.

06:02.340 --> 06:06.060
So this is good. So now we have successfully reviewed this.

06:06.060 --> 06:07.440
And another important thing:

06:07.440 --> 06:10.920
You will have something here is the image name.

06:10.920 --> 06:14.250
So get the latest docker image name so you can click on this

06:14.250 --> 06:17.640
and get a latest docker image name available and use it.

06:17.640 --> 06:21.540
So as on today it is V 0 10 0 2 available latest.

06:21.540 --> 06:25.140
So that's what we have updated here in our container's name.

06:25.140 --> 06:28.110
And then in image name we have updated this.

06:28.110 --> 06:30.420
So in our next lecture, we are going to go ahead

06:30.420 --> 06:32.760
and then deploy this external DNS.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.170
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

06:34.170 --> 06:35.943
Until then, bye bye. Thank you.
