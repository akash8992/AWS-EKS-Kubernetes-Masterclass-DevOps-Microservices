00:00.270 --> 00:01.230
-: Welcome back.

00:01.230 --> 00:02.580
As part of step five,

00:02.580 --> 00:05.790
we are going to deploy the external DNS.

00:05.790 --> 00:08.100
So let's go to our terminal here,

00:08.100 --> 00:10.320
and we'll enter into the section 08

00:10.320 --> 00:13.170
new year B application load balances.

00:13.170 --> 00:17.400
And inside that, we will go to 0807 0806,

00:19.710 --> 00:23.280
which is nothing but deploy external DNS.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.200
And we'll say kubectl.

00:25.200 --> 00:28.140
And if you want, we can verify a less alert year

00:28.140 --> 00:29.130
and Kube manifest.

00:29.130 --> 00:32.947
You'll find the 01 deploy external DNS.YML.

00:33.973 --> 00:38.280
So I'll say kubectl apply hyphen F and Kube manifest.

00:38.280 --> 00:42.840
So this should create or deploy the external DNS for us.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.363
So let's wait for it to complete.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.600
So we can see here,

00:48.600 --> 00:52.080
the service account external DNS configure cluster roll

00:52.080 --> 00:54.000
and then cluster roll binding created

00:54.000 --> 00:57.630
and deployment external DNS also created.

00:57.630 --> 00:59.400
And this warning, you can ignore.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.690
So that is fine.

01:00.690 --> 01:02.970
So now let's come back here

01:02.970 --> 01:05.370
and run the command kubectl,

01:05.370 --> 01:09.060
get all from the new default namespace.

01:09.060 --> 01:12.960
So all the deployments and whatever the resources present

01:12.960 --> 01:16.230
in default namespace, we are going to get here.

01:16.230 --> 01:21.230
So we can see here, external DNS pod is running

01:21.720 --> 01:25.020
and we can see external DNS related deployment

01:25.020 --> 01:28.680
and external DNS related ReplicaSet.

01:28.680 --> 01:29.910
And if we want,

01:29.910 --> 01:34.350
we can also list only the external DNS pod here.

01:34.350 --> 01:37.350
So get pods, right?

01:37.350 --> 01:41.250
And now you can see external DNS pod running.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.020
So if you want to verify the logs,

01:43.020 --> 01:44.340
so we can run this command

01:44.340 --> 01:48.270
to verify the external DNS pod logs here.

01:48.270 --> 01:51.240
And we can see if there are any errors or anything also,

01:51.240 --> 01:52.073
we can see here.

01:52.073 --> 01:55.740
All you can see is everything is working as expected

01:55.740 --> 01:58.110
and didn't see any errors here, right?

01:58.110 --> 02:00.630
So using in-cluster conflicts service token

02:00.630 --> 02:01.920
and created Kubernetes

02:01.920 --> 02:04.080
client applying provider record filter,

02:04.080 --> 02:06.660
all are info messages.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.370
So all are info messages.

02:08.370 --> 02:10.860
So there are no errors inside this.

02:10.860 --> 02:13.560
So if any errors also, it will be continuously throwing

02:13.560 --> 02:16.500
and then we can easily find it, right?

02:16.500 --> 02:19.050
So this completes that deployment

02:19.050 --> 02:22.770
of our external DNS related things.

02:22.770 --> 02:26.430
So what we have done, so we have created a IAM policy

02:26.430 --> 02:29.160
and we have created a Kubernetes service account

02:29.160 --> 02:31.440
with IAM role and annotated

02:31.440 --> 02:36.440
that IAM Kubernetes service account with the IAM role ERN.

02:36.450 --> 02:40.050
So all those things we have done using eksctl,

02:40.050 --> 02:43.020
create IAM service account command.

02:43.020 --> 02:45.840
And using that single command only further,

02:45.840 --> 02:49.950
we have also associated the IAM policy to IAM role.

02:49.950 --> 02:52.200
After that, we have updated

02:52.200 --> 02:55.710
the external DNS default manifest,

02:55.710 --> 03:00.180
which will create the external DNS related service account

03:00.180 --> 03:03.240
and cluster role, cluster role binding,

03:03.240 --> 03:06.750
and also it has created the deployment

03:06.750 --> 03:09.630
which created the external DNS pod.

03:09.630 --> 03:13.080
So this Kubernetes manifest, whatever it has created,

03:13.080 --> 03:14.400
whatever it has provided

03:14.400 --> 03:17.970
is from the external DNS related documentation.

03:17.970 --> 03:21.990
Ideally, already we have created this part.

03:21.990 --> 03:25.020
So we really don't need to have this here.

03:25.020 --> 03:27.120
We can remove it, if we don't want.

03:27.120 --> 03:30.120
But I took how the documentation is present,

03:30.120 --> 03:33.120
exactly how took in then put it here.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.220
But that's the reason you can see this error also

03:35.220 --> 03:36.390
whatever you're seeing, right?

03:36.390 --> 03:37.980
This a warning message.

03:37.980 --> 03:39.630
Also came because it is saying

03:39.630 --> 03:41.580
that you already have the external DNS

03:41.580 --> 03:43.560
and then why you are trying to reconfigure it

03:43.560 --> 03:44.760
or something like that.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.950
But ideally, we don't need this part,

03:46.950 --> 03:51.540
but it is given in the documentation I have, I read it.

03:51.540 --> 03:55.440
So deploy external DNS-related Kubernetes manifest.

03:55.440 --> 03:59.160
So we already using eksctl create IAM service account,

03:59.160 --> 04:01.530
we have created external DNS,

04:01.530 --> 04:03.120
and we have also annotated that

04:03.120 --> 04:05.580
with this respect to IAM role,

04:05.580 --> 04:08.640
which means this part here is not needed,

04:08.640 --> 04:11.190
so this service account part.

04:11.190 --> 04:14.820
But anyway, so it is part of the documentation manifest.

04:14.820 --> 04:16.650
So that's the reason I have put it in,

04:16.650 --> 04:18.090
which is no harm for us.

04:18.090 --> 04:19.800
So that is fine for us, right?

04:19.800 --> 04:21.720
So now, let's come back

04:21.720 --> 04:25.050
and in our next section or in the next demo,

04:25.050 --> 04:30.050
we are going to focus on using this external DNS concepts

04:30.300 --> 04:33.360
and adding the annotation in our Ingress service

04:33.360 --> 04:36.270
and then test it whether our DNS records

04:36.270 --> 04:40.770
get automatically created in Route 53 hosted zones.

04:40.770 --> 04:42.390
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

04:42.390 --> 04:43.590
Until then, bye-bye.

04:43.590 --> 04:44.423
Thank you.
