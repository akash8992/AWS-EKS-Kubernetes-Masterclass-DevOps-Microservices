00:00.300 --> 00:01.230
-: Welcome back.

00:01.230 --> 00:02.100
In this demo,

00:02.100 --> 00:05.040
we are going to add the external DNS annotation

00:05.040 --> 00:08.040
for our Kubernetes ingress service,

00:08.040 --> 00:08.910
and then test it

00:08.910 --> 00:11.790
and then see that whether our DNS records

00:11.790 --> 00:13.560
got automatically created

00:13.560 --> 00:18.270
by external DNS in Route 53 hosted zones.

00:18.270 --> 00:22.170
So let's see the network design once before moving on.

00:22.170 --> 00:24.060
So in the ingress service,

00:24.060 --> 00:28.200
we are going to add the external DNS-related annotations.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.760
And after that,

00:29.760 --> 00:32.910
it is going to automatically add the DNS names

00:32.910 --> 00:36.270
in the AWS Route 53 hosted zones,

00:36.270 --> 00:39.720
and we'll be able to test those DNS names

00:39.720 --> 00:43.500
by accessing them directly in the browser, right?

00:43.500 --> 00:47.430
So now let's go back to our GitHub repository

00:47.430 --> 00:51.150
and enter into the section 0807,

00:51.150 --> 00:56.150
use external DNS for Kubernetes ingress, right?

00:56.310 --> 00:58.410
And if you see here,

00:58.410 --> 01:02.880
update ingress manifest by adding external DNS annotation.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.360
So let's come back here

01:05.550 --> 01:07.530
to our Visual Studio code

01:07.530 --> 01:11.610
and enter into the section 0807,

01:11.610 --> 01:15.060
use external DNS for Kubernetes ingress

01:15.060 --> 01:17.880
and 010203 Kubernetes manifest

01:17.880 --> 01:20.010
for NGINX app one, app two, app three,

01:20.010 --> 01:22.830
no changes coming from the previous sections,

01:22.830 --> 01:25.680
and 04ALB ingress SSL redirect

01:25.680 --> 01:27.690
with external DNS is the thing

01:27.690 --> 01:30.780
which we are going to update here, right?

01:30.780 --> 01:33.210
So in this, the name of the ingress service

01:33.210 --> 01:36.630
is going to be ingress external DNS demo,

01:36.630 --> 01:41.130
and load balance, her name is external DNS ingress.

01:41.130 --> 01:42.690
And if you come down here,

01:42.690 --> 01:47.180
so this is the external DNS-related annotation.

01:48.120 --> 01:49.350
And inside that,

01:49.350 --> 01:52.410
we are providing comma-separated two DNS names:

01:52.410 --> 01:55.920
dnstest901.stacksimplify.com,

01:55.920 --> 01:59.850
DNS test 902.stacksimplify.com.

01:59.850 --> 02:02.820
So like this, you can add multiple DNSs

02:02.820 --> 02:04.380
or multiple subdomains,

02:04.380 --> 02:06.513
or even we have provided,

02:08.010 --> 02:10.500
currently, we didn't comment this part.

02:10.500 --> 02:11.640
We commented this part

02:11.640 --> 02:14.940
so that all the hosted zones will be applicable here,

02:14.940 --> 02:17.460
which means I have something called DevOps in cloud.

02:17.460 --> 02:19.890
So I can say abc.devops in cloud.

02:19.890 --> 02:23.880
So one more DNS will be added with abc.devops in cloud

02:23.880 --> 02:26.490
inside that DevOps in cloud hosted zone.

02:26.490 --> 02:27.780
See domain filter.

02:27.780 --> 02:29.430
We didn't provide any filter here.

02:29.430 --> 02:32.040
So which means all the applicable domains

02:32.040 --> 02:34.290
present in hosted zone can be added here,

02:34.290 --> 02:36.150
not only stacksimplify.com.

02:36.150 --> 02:38.040
So you can use other domains also

02:38.040 --> 02:40.560
because you have commented that option here

02:40.560 --> 02:43.200
and said that all the hosted zones present

02:43.200 --> 02:46.710
are applicable here to add the DNS entries

02:46.710 --> 02:48.360
by external DNS.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.070
For now, we are going to test

02:50.070 --> 02:53.370
with the dnstest901.stacksimplify.com

02:53.370 --> 02:56.850
and dnstest902.stacksimplify.com.

02:56.850 --> 02:59.820
In addition to that, another important thing here is,

02:59.820 --> 03:03.990
so if you need to ensure that this should be your domain.com

03:03.990 --> 03:06.057
and also ensure that your certificate here

03:06.057 --> 03:09.870
are also updated with your own certificate error

03:09.870 --> 03:12.330
in this ingress manifest, right?

03:12.330 --> 03:14.910
From your account, whatever the error is there,

03:14.910 --> 03:16.620
that one, you update it.

03:16.620 --> 03:19.690
So now let's go back to our GitHub report

03:20.640 --> 03:22.320
and move on to the next step

03:22.320 --> 03:26.250
which is deploy this Kubernetes manifest and then test it.

03:26.250 --> 03:29.340
So let's come back to terminal, clear,

03:29.340 --> 03:33.060
and come out of deploy external DNS-related section

03:33.060 --> 03:37.920
which is 0806 and go inside 0807.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.730
Use external DNS for ingress Kubernetes.

03:41.730 --> 03:46.730
And let's say LS-LRTA and Kube manifest

03:48.030 --> 03:51.900
just to check that we have all the files 01, 02, 03,

03:51.900 --> 03:54.270
and then 04, right?

03:54.270 --> 03:59.270
And we'll say kubectl, apply-F kube manifest.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.670
So this should deploy the app one, app two,

04:02.670 --> 04:06.060
app three related deployment and NodePort services

04:06.060 --> 04:07.050
and also create

04:07.050 --> 04:11.490
the external DNS-related ingress service, right?

04:11.490 --> 04:13.230
So now this is created.

04:13.230 --> 04:16.530
Another important thing here is the most important thing

04:16.530 --> 04:20.740
is let's keep monitoring your external DNS logs

04:21.750 --> 04:23.763
so that we'll get the clarity.

04:25.410 --> 04:26.553
Let's wait for it.

04:28.650 --> 04:33.650
So we can see here, create dns901stacksimplify.com

04:33.840 --> 04:36.450
and 902.stacksimplify.com.

04:36.450 --> 04:39.030
This is our core goal to verify that, right?

04:39.030 --> 04:43.680
So now let's go to Route 53 and go to stacksimplify.com

04:43.680 --> 04:48.680
and if you see here, DNS test 901, DNS test 902.

04:49.350 --> 04:51.750
And if you see the values inside them, right?

04:51.750 --> 04:56.105
So this is the external DNS ingress-related manifest

04:56.105 --> 05:01.105
load balancer service, so 144 863 844.

05:01.110 --> 05:03.120
So now let's come back here

05:03.120 --> 05:07.920
and go to the EC2 and find the same name here.

05:07.920 --> 05:11.790
So let's come back here and go to load balancers,

05:11.790 --> 05:15.720
and you should find the load balancer related DNS name,

05:15.720 --> 05:19.983
externaldns-ingress-1448638444.

05:21.420 --> 05:24.480
And here also, you'll find the same thing, right?

05:24.480 --> 05:29.280
1448638444, which means the DNS name,

05:29.280 --> 05:31.110
whatever you have created,

05:31.110 --> 05:36.110
is associated with your external ingress related DNS name.

05:37.200 --> 05:40.050
Load balancer DNS name successfully.

05:40.050 --> 05:42.690
So now the next thing here is go

05:42.690 --> 05:45.330
and then do the NS lookup tests, right?

05:45.330 --> 05:47.070
So let's come back here.

05:47.070 --> 05:50.250
So you have verified your external DNS pod

05:50.250 --> 05:52.080
with the create, create, create, create.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.430
All the things are good.

05:53.430 --> 05:55.140
So let's come out and do it,

05:55.140 --> 05:58.470
and let's look up test for DNS test 901

05:58.470 --> 06:00.810
and it is resolving to the IP address

06:00.810 --> 06:03.180
and also verify for 902

06:03.180 --> 06:06.150
and it is resolving to the IP address.

06:06.150 --> 06:07.140
So that is good.

06:07.140 --> 06:12.140
And if you want, you can access the application DNS test 901

06:12.300 --> 06:13.743
and then 902.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.760
So let me close this IAM,

06:17.760 --> 06:21.900
come back here, and DNS test 901 is good

06:21.900 --> 06:24.030
and this is app one is good

06:24.030 --> 06:27.240
and app two with a DNS test 901 is good

06:27.240 --> 06:30.390
and also we'll access the root context also.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.750
So all redirected from http to https

06:33.750 --> 06:37.950
and everything is accessible with DNS test 901.

06:37.950 --> 06:39.690
So now close this tab

06:39.690 --> 06:40.523
and if you want,

06:40.523 --> 06:44.610
you can also access with DNS test 902, right?

06:44.610 --> 06:46.860
You are accessing the http URL

06:46.860 --> 06:49.650
and it should auto redirect to https, right?

06:49.650 --> 06:52.230
You can see the certificate lock symbol here.

06:52.230 --> 06:54.510
And app one is good and if we want,

06:54.510 --> 06:59.510
we can also access the app two with 902 and that is good

07:00.660 --> 07:04.290
and root context also we can access and then test it.

07:04.290 --> 07:07.770
So this completes the verification

07:07.770 --> 07:12.770
of using the external DNS with the ingress service, right?

07:13.500 --> 07:16.290
And another important thing here is when you are testing it,

07:16.290 --> 07:18.780
this should be you domain name.

07:18.780 --> 07:21.420
And now, we'll go ahead and then clean up this

07:21.420 --> 07:23.490
and it should also delete the 901

07:23.490 --> 07:25.800
and then 902 DNS records, why?

07:25.800 --> 07:28.290
Because if you go back here, right?

07:28.290 --> 07:29.940
So if you go back to here

07:29.940 --> 07:33.270
and if you see you have commented this policy upset only,

07:33.270 --> 07:36.690
so which means it should be in the full synchronization.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.850
Whenever you delete your ingress resource,

07:38.850 --> 07:42.180
automatically, the DNS records updated

07:42.180 --> 07:44.220
inside that ingress service, right?

07:44.220 --> 07:45.660
Whatever is present inside that

07:45.660 --> 07:48.360
in the external DNS related annotation,

07:48.360 --> 07:51.510
so those should get automatically deleted.

07:51.510 --> 07:54.570
So let's go here and say kubectl,

07:54.570 --> 07:57.840
delete-F, and Kube manifest.

07:57.840 --> 08:00.600
And once you delete it, immediately go ahead

08:00.600 --> 08:04.920
and then start monitoring your external DNS logs, right?

08:04.920 --> 08:07.440
So let it delete, right?

08:07.440 --> 08:09.303
Ingress service is getting deleted.

08:10.320 --> 08:13.710
So let's wait for the command line to come for us.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.300
We'll monitor the logs here

08:15.300 --> 08:18.663
and let's wait for it, wait for the logs.

08:19.710 --> 08:21.480
So you can see create logs you have seen.

08:21.480 --> 08:23.760
Let's wait further delete logs

08:23.760 --> 08:28.440
in the external DNS logs for external DNS pod.

08:28.440 --> 08:31.440
In meantime, we can go here and then verify

08:31.440 --> 08:35.460
if our load balancer is successfully deleted.

08:35.460 --> 08:36.300
So this is good.

08:36.300 --> 08:38.250
So we need to always ensure

08:38.250 --> 08:42.270
that our application load balancer is successfully deleted.

08:42.270 --> 08:43.770
By any chance it is present,

08:43.770 --> 08:46.590
again, it is going to add cost for us.

08:46.590 --> 08:50.580
See now, you are back to your external DNS pod logs

08:50.580 --> 08:53.940
and you can see it is having the desire change,

08:53.940 --> 08:56.580
which is a delete so and so DNSs

08:56.580 --> 08:58.980
and it has deleted those DNSs

08:58.980 --> 09:01.440
and successfully updated that hosted zone.

09:01.440 --> 09:04.950
So now come back here and go to Route 53

09:04.950 --> 09:09.870
and go back and again go inside stacksimplify.com

09:09.870 --> 09:11.760
and you should not find anything related

09:11.760 --> 09:15.510
to DNS test 901 or 902.

09:15.510 --> 09:17.940
So which means whenever you have created

09:17.940 --> 09:19.200
that ingress resource,

09:19.200 --> 09:24.200
it has automatically created those external DNS records

09:24.480 --> 09:27.210
in the Route 53 using external DNS.

09:27.210 --> 09:28.740
And whenever you have deleted

09:28.740 --> 09:31.050
or destroyed your ingress resource

09:31.050 --> 09:33.540
or you undeployed your ingress resource,

09:33.540 --> 09:37.380
automatically, external DNS also remove your DNS entries

09:37.380 --> 09:40.230
from your Route 53 service.

09:40.230 --> 09:43.620
So this completes the external DNS

09:43.620 --> 09:45.330
with ingress service demo.

09:45.330 --> 09:48.870
In the next demo, we are going to do the external DNS

09:48.870 --> 09:51.630
with regular Kubernetes service demo.

09:51.630 --> 09:53.250
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.023
Until then, bye-bye. Thank you.
