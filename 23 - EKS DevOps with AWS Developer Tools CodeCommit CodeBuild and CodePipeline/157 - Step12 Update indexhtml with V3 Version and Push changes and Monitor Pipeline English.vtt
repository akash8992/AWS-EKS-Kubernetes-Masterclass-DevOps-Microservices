00:00.180 --> 00:01.200
-: Welcome back.

00:01.200 --> 00:04.260
In previous lecture, we have completed testing

00:04.260 --> 00:07.920
by fixing the SDS Zoom role fix, okay?

00:07.920 --> 00:10.620
So now we are going to change the app version

00:10.620 --> 00:13.080
to V2 or V3 and then checking the code

00:13.080 --> 00:14.940
and then see how pipeline triggers

00:14.940 --> 00:17.850
and then how the changes flow across the thing, okay?

00:17.850 --> 00:21.680
So now let me go and then close this EC2

00:21.680 --> 00:23.430
or we can leave it like this.

00:23.430 --> 00:25.320
So the next thing is make changes

00:25.320 --> 00:26.970
in the index data html, okay?

00:26.970 --> 00:30.060
So we can say V3 or V2, whatever it is, okay?

00:30.060 --> 00:34.470
So we'll go there and then make the change, right?

00:34.470 --> 00:36.300
So let me make this smaller.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.410
Let me close this.

00:37.410 --> 00:40.200
And here is the folder I have added

00:40.200 --> 00:43.020
from my local get triple, right?

00:43.020 --> 00:44.880
And this is the index.html.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.940
So I'm going to say something like V3, okay?

00:47.940 --> 00:50.100
And then I will save it, okay?

00:50.100 --> 00:53.640
And if I go here and then say get status,

00:53.640 --> 00:56.370
so there is a change for our index.html.

00:56.370 --> 01:01.370
So I will say get add, get commit, hyphen am,

01:02.100 --> 01:05.850
and V3 deployment, I will say, okay?

01:05.850 --> 01:09.270
And I will say get push, right?

01:09.270 --> 01:10.590
And now we'll go back

01:10.590 --> 01:13.230
and then verify the same thing on our pipeline.

01:13.230 --> 01:18.230
So let's go here and go to our pipelines.

01:18.540 --> 01:21.390
And if you open this DevOps pipeline,

01:21.390 --> 01:23.160
so currently, nothing one added.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.170
First set is the source it is referencing.

01:25.170 --> 01:27.750
So let's wait for the changes to happen.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.640
So now the changes came in.

01:29.640 --> 01:32.940
So V3 deployment is the source it is referencing now

01:32.940 --> 01:34.770
and it moved onto the build phase.

01:34.770 --> 01:37.503
And then here, if I click on details,

01:38.370 --> 01:41.640
we will see that build locks now, right?

01:41.640 --> 01:44.130
So let's wait for the build locks

01:44.130 --> 01:46.563
to come in here to see what happens, right?

01:47.850 --> 01:48.750
We got the locks

01:48.750 --> 01:50.940
and then it says that status also succeeded.

01:50.940 --> 01:54.240
So we can go down and then all the changes looks good.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.430
It is going down, down, down, down.

01:56.430 --> 01:59.250
So it went here and then as you move the role

01:59.250 --> 02:00.780
and then if you see it here earlier,

02:00.780 --> 02:02.970
it got created because it is the first time.

02:02.970 --> 02:05.340
So now it is saying configured, right?

02:05.340 --> 02:08.850
So far EKS DevOps deployment, okay?

02:08.850 --> 02:11.820
So inside this EKS DevOps deployment object,

02:11.820 --> 02:12.780
it said configured.

02:12.780 --> 02:16.350
But we didn't change anything related to node port service

02:16.350 --> 02:17.370
or Ingress service.

02:17.370 --> 02:20.070
So it is in the unchanged state only, okay?

02:20.070 --> 02:22.020
And then we completed this.

02:22.020 --> 02:24.060
So now we can go back

02:24.060 --> 02:27.150
and then verify our EC2 management console.

02:27.150 --> 02:28.800
This is nothing unchanged, okay?

02:28.800 --> 02:30.690
So nothing happened here, okay?

02:30.690 --> 02:34.920
So now if we click here, Enter, it should become V3, right?

02:34.920 --> 02:36.210
Whatever we have provided.

02:36.210 --> 02:40.170
So one thing we didn't check here is S3 buckets, right?

02:40.170 --> 02:42.321
So we also need to see our source

02:42.321 --> 02:45.150
build whatever has the artifact section.

02:45.150 --> 02:48.690
So in artifacts section for our buildspec.yml,

02:48.690 --> 02:51.749
so whatever we said is take the build.gsn

02:51.749 --> 02:54.120
and then kube manifests, okay?

02:54.120 --> 02:58.800
So kube manifests should have our respective deployment file

02:58.800 --> 03:00.630
and then this value should be replaced

03:00.630 --> 03:02.220
with the latest container image.

03:02.220 --> 03:03.690
So we need to verify that, okay?

03:03.690 --> 03:07.200
So that's our understanding and the learning process

03:07.200 --> 03:10.050
about what happened inside that, right?

03:10.050 --> 03:11.880
So let's go there and then verify that.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.230
So go to build details,

03:13.230 --> 03:16.710
and if you go inside build details, so if you see here,

03:16.710 --> 03:19.620
artifact upload location, inside artifacts.

03:19.620 --> 03:21.780
So if you click on that, this is the correct build

03:21.780 --> 03:25.260
whatever happened as part of this current build, okay?

03:25.260 --> 03:28.170
So I'll open that, right?

03:28.170 --> 03:31.830
And it opened this respective build.

03:31.830 --> 03:33.933
So I'm going to download it.

03:38.130 --> 03:40.410
So I have downloaded it and then opened it

03:40.410 --> 03:44.460
in my local BLKHS7WA, right?

03:44.460 --> 03:46.140
So it is matching the same thing here.

03:46.140 --> 03:48.780
I'll go inside kube manifest, right?

03:48.780 --> 03:51.360
So if you see here in the builder.json

03:51.360 --> 03:55.050
open with the Visual Studio code,

03:55.050 --> 03:57.450
you'll find the image URL, right?

03:57.450 --> 04:02.450
So at the end, you'll see that 09631C52, right?

04:03.210 --> 04:06.450
So you can see the same in our bill logs also,

04:06.450 --> 04:07.653
we should see that okay.

04:12.270 --> 04:14.160
Repository, when we are pushing it,

04:14.160 --> 04:15.540
we are printing it, okay?

04:15.540 --> 04:19.650
So here, okay, so 09613C52.

04:19.650 --> 04:22.740
So this is what we pushed it and then we found the same.

04:22.740 --> 04:26.490
At the end, you can see 3C52, 3C52.

04:26.490 --> 04:27.660
The same thing you should see

04:27.660 --> 04:31.833
in our DevOps deployment object, okay?

04:31.833 --> 04:33.810
So go to kube manifest

04:33.810 --> 04:38.220
and then see this and you'll find that, okay?

04:38.220 --> 04:41.700
So container image is replaced with the repository URL

04:41.700 --> 04:45.750
and then tag with the 09613C52.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.310
So that's the thing, okay?

04:47.310 --> 04:49.710
So we have verified those things, good.

04:49.710 --> 04:52.290
So now I am happy, okay?

04:52.290 --> 04:53.640
So this completes this

04:53.640 --> 04:55.020
and now what we are going to do

04:55.020 --> 04:56.550
is we have verified this stuff, okay?

04:56.550 --> 04:58.230
V3 stuff, okay?

04:58.230 --> 05:01.200
Now we are going to make a change to our Ingress manifest

05:01.200 --> 05:04.890
by adding additional DevOps to .q1cloud.com.

05:04.890 --> 05:08.010
So these changes are not only

05:08.010 --> 05:11.340
for our Docker application images,

05:11.340 --> 05:13.410
but even if you want to apply the changes

05:13.410 --> 05:14.640
for your kube manifest,

05:14.640 --> 05:17.580
only thing is your application build one more time generated

05:17.580 --> 05:19.620
and then new Docker image came,

05:19.620 --> 05:22.590
but still you'll be able to do it this way, okay?

05:22.590 --> 05:25.740
So devops.devops2.kube1cloud.com,

05:25.740 --> 05:28.320
you are going to add for our manifest here.

05:28.320 --> 05:29.938
So this is our Ingress manifest

05:29.938 --> 05:33.150
in our local get triple, right?

05:33.150 --> 05:35.730
So I'll go here and then copy this

05:35.730 --> 05:38.940
and I'll put a comma space,

05:38.940 --> 05:41.640
and then I'll say DevOps two,

05:41.640 --> 05:44.190
and then I will save it, right?

05:44.190 --> 05:47.220
And if I go back here and then clear

05:47.220 --> 05:51.780
and if I say get status, so my Ingress service has a change.

05:51.780 --> 05:54.570
So I'll say getcommit-am,

05:54.570 --> 05:58.493
and I'm going to say V4 and V4 deployment.

05:58.493 --> 06:02.937
And I'm going to say Ingress DevOps two

06:08.340 --> 06:11.010
DNS name change, right?

06:11.010 --> 06:13.310
And then I'm going to push this change

06:13.310 --> 06:16.290
to the remote code commit repository, right?

06:16.290 --> 06:17.970
So the change is pushed.

06:17.970 --> 06:20.250
So let's go back here

06:20.250 --> 06:24.663
and go to our code build and go to our pipeline, right?

06:25.620 --> 06:29.133
And now soon the pipeline should trigger, it triggered.

06:30.150 --> 06:31.470
So if you see here,

06:31.470 --> 06:34.470
code committee is picking the latest source now.

06:34.470 --> 06:36.663
So let's wait for the source to be picked.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.893
Once it is picked, it will move on to the build phase.

06:42.930 --> 06:44.463
So let's wait for it.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.440
So good.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.960
So now we got the Ingress DevOps

06:47.960 --> 06:50.160
to DNS name change related thing.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.900
So now the build is running.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.770
So I'm going to click on details

06:54.750 --> 06:56.820
and we'll go to that respective build details

06:56.820 --> 06:57.900
and then logs.

06:57.900 --> 06:59.820
So we can see build got succeeded

06:59.820 --> 07:01.770
and all the phases got succeeded.

07:01.770 --> 07:05.550
So let's go to build logs and verify what it changed, right?

07:05.550 --> 07:07.920
So you can see Ingress manifest got configured

07:07.920 --> 07:10.710
and then deployment because Docker also runs

07:10.710 --> 07:12.210
for creating a new Docker image.

07:12.210 --> 07:14.580
So deployment also got configured,

07:14.580 --> 07:17.310
and then node port service unchanged, okay?

07:17.310 --> 07:20.970
So now, let's go back to our route 53

07:20.970 --> 07:24.030
and then verify if we have a new

07:24.030 --> 07:25.800
two more DNS names here, okay?

07:25.800 --> 07:29.553
So let's go to hostage zones and Q1 cloud.

07:30.420 --> 07:33.210
So we need to refresh the entire stuff here, okay?

07:33.210 --> 07:34.620
So screen refresh, okay?

07:34.620 --> 07:37.680
Browser refresh, that's good, okay?

07:37.680 --> 07:40.800
And I'm not sure why this still didn't come.

07:40.800 --> 07:41.633
It got it right.

07:41.633 --> 07:46.170
So devops2.q1cloud.com, you can see them here, okay?

07:46.170 --> 07:49.860
So now let's go to here and then clear it

07:49.860 --> 07:53.780
and then say NS lookup devops2.q1cloud.com.

07:57.480 --> 07:59.730
And then it's resolving 13 and triple two.

07:59.730 --> 08:01.080
It looks good.

08:01.080 --> 08:05.070
So now, take it in a new tab,

08:05.070 --> 08:10.070
http//devops2.kubeoncloud.com/1/index.html.

08:19.530 --> 08:21.480
So now we should have our application

08:21.480 --> 08:25.140
up and running with V3 version, right?

08:25.140 --> 08:27.270
So this is very nice now.

08:27.270 --> 08:32.130
So this completes the DevOps section implementation

08:32.130 --> 08:36.240
with code commit, code build, and then code pipeline.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.430
So if you want to delete all the manifest,

08:38.430 --> 08:41.580
whatever we created, we need to delete definitely

08:41.580 --> 08:44.010
because we have a load balancer here

08:44.010 --> 08:45.630
which is charging, okay?

08:45.630 --> 08:46.710
So which is chargeable

08:46.710 --> 08:49.440
and then it'll be a high price, right?

08:49.440 --> 08:51.690
So first, let's remove that manifest.

08:51.690 --> 08:55.170
So as you in your local already kubectl is configured.

08:55.170 --> 08:56.100
So I am going to say,

08:56.100 --> 08:59.340
and I am inside this DevOps engine X folder only

08:59.340 --> 09:01.530
and I have the kube manifest here.

09:01.530 --> 09:05.040
So I'm going to say kubectl delete hyphen F kube manifest.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.330
So I'm doing the full cleanup

09:06.330 --> 09:10.410
of my whatever I have created inside Kubernetes cluster.

09:10.410 --> 09:12.060
So once that is done,

09:12.060 --> 09:14.880
so we'll also remove the other stuff, right?

09:14.880 --> 09:16.800
So now this is done.

09:16.800 --> 09:21.330
If I go ahead and then say kubectl get pods,

09:21.330 --> 09:23.100
nothing should be there, right?

09:23.100 --> 09:24.360
External DNS only.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.010
Right? Yeah.

09:26.010 --> 09:29.070
Now let's go here and my load balancer is gone.

09:29.070 --> 09:31.560
Good, so now this is good.

09:31.560 --> 09:32.670
So now we'll go back

09:32.670 --> 09:36.210
and then removal pipeline is per month $1 or something.

09:36.210 --> 09:37.043
It charges.

09:37.043 --> 09:39.707
If you want, you can even delete that pipeline, okay?

09:39.707 --> 09:42.210
So I'm going to say delete no resource

09:42.210 --> 09:44.010
that needed for this source action.

09:44.010 --> 09:45.690
So delete, okay.

09:45.690 --> 09:47.430
So I deleted it, okay.

09:47.430 --> 09:48.720
So now pipeline is gone.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.730
So we have the code built projects here

09:50.730 --> 09:52.260
which we are going to clean up.

09:52.260 --> 09:56.553
So EKS DevOps pipe, so I'm going to delete it.

09:57.510 --> 10:01.743
So delete build project, and I'm going to say delete.

10:03.090 --> 10:05.580
And I'm also going to delete the old ones

10:05.580 --> 10:07.350
which I have created as part of this.

10:07.350 --> 10:08.880
Also, let me delete this

10:08.880 --> 10:11.043
so that it will be clean for us, okay?

10:15.150 --> 10:17.970
Good, so now only one thing we have with us

10:17.970 --> 10:20.730
is code commit, right?

10:20.730 --> 10:23.820
So let's go here and then in code commit,

10:23.820 --> 10:27.750
we have something called EKS DevOps engine X.

10:27.750 --> 10:30.540
So if you're not interested, you can delete this repository.

10:30.540 --> 10:33.240
But usually, I hold my repository here.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.100
It doesn't cost much for me,

10:35.100 --> 10:36.570
so I leave it like this, okay?

10:36.570 --> 10:39.750
So if you want, you can delete this repository also.

10:39.750 --> 10:42.300
So this completes the cleanup process.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.410
Also, in addition to that,

10:43.410 --> 10:45.060
if you want to delete all the roles,

10:45.060 --> 10:47.640
whatever we have created as part of this,

10:47.640 --> 10:50.160
so you can go there and then even delete those, okay?

10:50.160 --> 10:53.230
So we can say IM surveys

10:54.218 --> 10:57.090
and if we go for the roles,

10:57.090 --> 11:00.300
so we'll find something called EKS, right?

11:00.300 --> 11:04.140
And then we'll find something called code build EKS DevOps.

11:04.140 --> 11:06.870
This is one rule which we have created.

11:06.870 --> 11:11.870
And EKS code build kubectl role, this one we have created.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.923
So let's delete them, okay.

11:16.290 --> 11:18.480
Good, and these roles are related

11:18.480 --> 11:20.490
to CloudWatch related roles, events.

11:20.490 --> 11:22.830
If you want, you can even delete them, okay?

11:22.830 --> 11:24.750
So I'll leave it as is for me.

11:24.750 --> 11:28.140
So this completes the entire DevOps section

11:28.140 --> 11:29.640
we have implemented.

11:29.640 --> 11:32.940
So in our next section, we'll focus on another concept

11:32.940 --> 11:36.390
like microservices or autoscaling or something else.

11:36.390 --> 11:38.130
So until then, bye-bye.

11:38.130 --> 11:38.963
Thank you.
