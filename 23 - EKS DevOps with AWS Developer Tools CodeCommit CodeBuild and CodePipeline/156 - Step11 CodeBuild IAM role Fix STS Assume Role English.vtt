00:00.150 --> 00:02.460
-: Welcome back in previous lecture.

00:02.460 --> 00:06.270
We have completed till here where we are getting the failure

00:06.270 --> 00:11.270
from AWS STS assumed role with access denied, right?

00:11.730 --> 00:14.010
So now what we need to do is we'll go back

00:14.010 --> 00:15.690
over guitar report

00:15.690 --> 00:18.660
and then we'll fix it that respective to steps.

00:18.660 --> 00:20.910
So update code build role to have

00:20.910 --> 00:24.997
access to STS Assume Role we have created

00:24.997 --> 00:28.410
using STS Assume Role Policy, right?

00:28.410 --> 00:31.988
So we need to create a STS Assume Role Policy.

00:31.988 --> 00:35.820
Now, so let's go to our IAM.

00:35.820 --> 00:39.336
Right, so let me, yeah, so let's go to

00:39.336 --> 00:43.710
policies in IAM and create a policy,

00:43.710 --> 00:46.800
and choose a service, right?

00:46.800 --> 00:51.123
So when you choose the service search for STS, right?

00:52.488 --> 00:55.920
STS, and in actions select inside-right,

00:55.920 --> 01:00.920
assume role, and in resources right?

01:01.020 --> 01:06.020
So in a specific resource section select add RN

01:06.390 --> 01:08.130
and provide your AR and

01:08.130 --> 01:12.840
off your cube EKS, cube CTL related code build role.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.660
So which is nothing but whatever you have provided

01:15.660 --> 01:18.630
in your and your AR mental variable here, right?

01:18.630 --> 01:21.450
So this role you need to provide, okay?

01:21.450 --> 01:23.808
So if you want you can even search this

01:23.808 --> 01:25.650
code built Q CTL role in your

01:25.650 --> 01:28.830
IAM and then get that information

01:28.830 --> 01:30.870
and then paste it here okay?

01:30.870 --> 01:34.427
So you can go here and then go to IAM, right,

01:37.200 --> 01:40.803
and in IAM search for this respective role, right?

01:40.803 --> 01:43.680
With this role name, right?

01:43.680 --> 01:47.550
So go to roles and search for this role,

01:47.550 --> 01:50.460
open this role, and then copy the AR;

01:50.460 --> 01:54.540
and from here, and then paste it here, that's all.

01:54.540 --> 01:55.380
Okay.

01:55.380 --> 01:58.800
And then click on add, and then we are done here, okay?

01:58.800 --> 02:02.190
So if you want we can click on review policy,

02:02.190 --> 02:04.320
and then provide the name of that, okay?

02:04.320 --> 02:06.990
So this is the STS assumed role.

02:06.990 --> 02:11.550
So the role name I'm going to give is EKS code

02:11.550 --> 02:15.000
builds STS assume role related policy, okay?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.170
So where is that?

02:16.170 --> 02:18.213
So it should be somewhere here, okay?

02:19.170 --> 02:21.870
And I'll provide code build to interact

02:21.870 --> 02:25.860
with EKS cluster to perform changes, right?

02:25.860 --> 02:27.900
So I'll come here and provide this

02:27.900 --> 02:29.703
and then create the policy.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.510
Once this policy is created

02:33.510 --> 02:36.570
I'm going to go to the roles, right?

02:36.570 --> 02:38.220
And then associate this role.

02:38.220 --> 02:39.330
It means like I have a code

02:39.330 --> 02:41.880
build EK develops CB related role, right?

02:41.880 --> 02:43.770
So it means like my code build role.

02:43.770 --> 02:47.490
So I can go here, and go to build details

02:47.490 --> 02:50.070
and go to my code build service role, Okay?

02:50.070 --> 02:51.480
So this is the role.

02:51.480 --> 02:56.220
So I'll go to that service role and I'll go to

02:56.220 --> 02:59.550
attach policies, and I will try and then search

02:59.550 --> 03:03.123
for our EKS code build EKS code build, right?

03:07.800 --> 03:10.680
STS assume role related policy, okay?

03:10.680 --> 03:12.990
So I'll say attach policy, that's all.

03:12.990 --> 03:16.500
So now my code build EKS DevOps related

03:16.500 --> 03:18.330
whatever is associated with my code

03:18.330 --> 03:21.420
will project also gets the STS assume role

03:21.420 --> 03:24.300
related policy associated with it, okay?

03:24.300 --> 03:26.910
So now what happens is if a run that changes

03:26.910 --> 03:28.290
then it is going to succeed.

03:28.290 --> 03:30.690
So let me close this, let me close this

03:30.690 --> 03:33.123
let me close this all, I'm closing.

03:34.543 --> 03:36.900
So now we'll go to pipelines, right?

03:36.900 --> 03:39.510
And now one more time we will select that pipeline

03:39.510 --> 03:42.180
and then do the release change, okay?

03:42.180 --> 03:43.830
So we still didn't make changes,

03:43.830 --> 03:44.663
and push anything.

03:44.663 --> 03:46.470
We can do a release change like this, okay?

03:46.470 --> 03:48.570
So in my, in our case, what I've done is

03:48.570 --> 03:51.300
in my documentation we can do this way

03:51.300 --> 03:56.220
or we can even do something called make a change

03:56.220 --> 03:57.330
and then push it, okay?

03:57.330 --> 04:00.120
So whatever the things works for us, okay?

04:00.120 --> 04:03.420
So make a change and push it from your local or do this way.

04:03.420 --> 04:07.020
So I just done a release change here, anything is fine.

04:07.020 --> 04:11.523
So now let's go here and then verify this stuff, okay?

04:13.950 --> 04:15.930
And this is going on.

04:15.930 --> 04:19.890
So once this is ready we will see what happens.

04:19.890 --> 04:20.723
So good.

04:20.723 --> 04:23.878
So now it verified the AWS version.

04:23.878 --> 04:26.460
So lots of things are getting succeeded.

04:26.460 --> 04:28.080
Now the build thing is going on.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.660
So once the build is completed

04:30.660 --> 04:34.770
so it is going to move onto the next steps, okay?

04:34.770 --> 04:36.900
So push also completed.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.660
Now you can see it here, running commands, AWS,

04:39.660 --> 04:43.290
STS Assume Role this one got succeeded and

04:43.290 --> 04:45.450
it went to access key id next step

04:45.450 --> 04:46.710
and then secret access key.

04:46.710 --> 04:48.645
All these next steps are getting executed.

04:48.645 --> 04:51.780
And then now if you see here

04:51.780 --> 04:56.780
we said that AWS EKS update cube config name EKS cluster.

04:56.970 --> 05:01.170
So it already updated our cube config information

05:01.170 --> 05:04.560
and then it moved to the next step of cube CTL

05:04.560 --> 05:07.530
apply hyphen F cube manifests, okay?

05:07.530 --> 05:09.900
So it applied the change, so that deployment

05:09.900 --> 05:11.760
got created, note port service

05:11.760 --> 05:14.580
got created, and then DevOps service got created.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.680
So all these things got created, why?

05:16.680 --> 05:18.120
Because it is the first time, right?

05:18.120 --> 05:21.210
So those are not there, and then it got created,

05:21.210 --> 05:23.400
and then changes completed, and then

05:23.400 --> 05:26.036
it also created the artifacts here, okay?

05:26.036 --> 05:28.680
So which we can reference for future stages

05:28.680 --> 05:30.600
if we implement anything, okay?

05:30.600 --> 05:33.210
So now these changes completed, so let's

05:33.210 --> 05:38.210
come back here and say cube CTL get ports, right?

05:42.030 --> 05:44.760
So on our cluster we should have EK DevOps

05:44.760 --> 05:47.370
related to ports up and running.

05:47.370 --> 05:51.150
So I'll also say cube CTL get ingress, right?

05:51.150 --> 05:53.130
So ingress should be created.

05:53.130 --> 05:57.780
So now what I will do is we can go to in our

05:57.780 --> 06:00.930
We'll open and then go to EC2, right?

06:00.930 --> 06:05.930
And go there, and then go to load balances

06:06.570 --> 06:09.060
and verify our load balancer application load

06:09.060 --> 06:11.040
balancer is getting created.

06:11.040 --> 06:13.530
So it's getting created, right?

06:13.530 --> 06:16.980
So we'll also verify our Route 53 domain.

06:16.980 --> 06:18.780
So that should be also registered, right?

06:18.780 --> 06:21.156
So our Route 53 domain should be mostly

06:21.156 --> 06:24.000
DevOps.cube1cloud.com.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.880
So let's also verify that, right?

06:26.880 --> 06:31.230
So let's go here and go to cube1cloud.com

06:31.230 --> 06:34.443
and you should see DevOps related thing here, okay?

06:36.890 --> 06:40.290
DevOps.cube1cloud.com, so that's good.

06:40.290 --> 06:45.290
So once this respective load balancer is provisioned, right?

06:45.930 --> 06:48.150
So we'll be able to verify that stuff

06:48.150 --> 06:49.500
so we can even see the target

06:49.500 --> 06:51.720
group and the targets.

06:51.720 --> 06:55.260
So it's still in progress and then they are healthy.

06:55.260 --> 06:57.570
So we'll see load balancer is active now.

06:57.570 --> 07:01.031
So let's take that DNS and do the NS lookup, okay?

07:01.031 --> 07:04.290
So this is always good to do this verification

07:04.290 --> 07:07.137
and it provided some IPS 222 at the end

07:07.137 --> 07:09.150
and then 13, so I'll do the same

07:09.150 --> 07:14.150
for NS lookup, and then DevOps.cube1cloud.com.

07:15.330 --> 07:17.850
So it also provided 13 and then 222,

07:17.850 --> 07:19.410
so which means we are good.

07:19.410 --> 07:22.953
So now we'll go to our browser, right?

07:22.953 --> 07:27.953
STT://devOps.cube1cloud.com/app1/indexations

07:34.800 --> 07:36.450
right?

07:36.450 --> 07:40.620
So now I got the app version V1, so that's good.

07:40.620 --> 07:42.720
So in our next lecture we'll focus

07:42.720 --> 07:45.420
on changing the version to V2, checking the code

07:45.420 --> 07:48.966
and then how it changes we are going to see, okay?

07:48.966 --> 07:51.030
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

07:51.030 --> 07:52.380
Until then, bye bye.

07:52.380 --> 07:53.213
Thank you.
