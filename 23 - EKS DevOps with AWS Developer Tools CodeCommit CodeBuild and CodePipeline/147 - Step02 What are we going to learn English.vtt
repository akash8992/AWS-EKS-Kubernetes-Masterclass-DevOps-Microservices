00:00.120 --> 00:00.953
-: Welcome back.

00:00.953 --> 00:02.970
In this lecture we are going to understand

00:02.970 --> 00:04.470
about what we are going to learn

00:04.470 --> 00:06.231
as part of this entire thing, right?

00:06.231 --> 00:09.420
So we are going to create a easier repository

00:09.420 --> 00:11.320
for our Docker images to be stored there

00:11.320 --> 00:15.030
and we are going to create our code, comment get repository

00:15.030 --> 00:16.832
and then check in our docker

00:16.832 --> 00:21.214
and then Kubernetes manifest whatever we are going to use

00:21.214 --> 00:25.290
as part of this specific section.

00:25.290 --> 00:28.150
And we are going to write a build spec dot yml

00:28.150 --> 00:30.600
or review the build spec dot yml

00:30.600 --> 00:32.790
which will build the docker image

00:32.790 --> 00:34.380
and then push the Docker image

00:34.380 --> 00:38.880
to the ECR repository and deploy the updated KS

00:38.880 --> 00:41.466
deployment manifesto EKS cluster.

00:41.466 --> 00:44.610
So in addition to that, we also need to

00:44.610 --> 00:48.265
be aware a few important roles that need to be created

00:48.265 --> 00:52.740
and then associated with the code build role.

00:52.740 --> 00:56.070
So one important role is STS assumerole

00:56.070 --> 00:59.386
which is nothing but EKS code build kubectl role

00:59.386 --> 01:02.628
which will have that EKS describe function inside that.

01:02.628 --> 01:07.628
So with this role, we will be able to apply the changes

01:08.040 --> 01:11.790
to our Kubernetes using codebuild role from codebuild.

01:11.790 --> 01:14.040
So for that purpose, we'll create this role

01:14.040 --> 01:16.605
and then associate that to the codebuild role.

01:16.605 --> 01:19.920
So in addition to that codebuild role also

01:19.920 --> 01:22.320
should have the access to push the images

01:22.320 --> 01:27.180
to this ECR repository so it needs ECR full access.

01:27.180 --> 01:29.820
And this respective STS assumerole

01:29.820 --> 01:32.426
you need to associate in this respective codebuild role.

01:32.426 --> 01:36.000
You need to create a STS assumerole policy

01:36.000 --> 01:40.018
and then associate this role in a way it is required.

01:40.018 --> 01:43.080
So we are going to do all these things in different

01:43.080 --> 01:45.570
different steps and in a very step by step

01:45.570 --> 01:47.520
and then organize it manner so

01:47.520 --> 01:50.370
that you really don't miss any steps here.

01:50.370 --> 01:54.300
Okay? So all these steps are detailed, documented

01:54.300 --> 01:55.956
so that nothing will miss or

01:55.956 --> 01:59.790
nothing will misfire us to not to succeed

01:59.790 --> 02:01.320
about this section.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.930
Okay? So even for STS, assumerole

02:03.930 --> 02:05.910
also the detailed steps are provided

02:05.910 --> 02:10.020
and even for creating odd config map related information

02:10.020 --> 02:11.217
on our EKS cluster.

02:11.217 --> 02:14.552
Those also, we have very detailed information provided here

02:14.552 --> 02:18.780
and you can just go through this section and then execute it

02:18.780 --> 02:22.763
and then you will be successfully implementing the DevOps

02:22.763 --> 02:24.908
for our Kubernetes manifest.

02:24.908 --> 02:27.227
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

02:27.227 --> 02:28.958
Until then, bye bye.

02:28.958 --> 02:30.123
Thank you.
