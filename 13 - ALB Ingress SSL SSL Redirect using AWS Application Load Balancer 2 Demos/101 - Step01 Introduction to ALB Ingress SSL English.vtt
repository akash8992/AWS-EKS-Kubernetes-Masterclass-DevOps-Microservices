00:00.750 --> 00:01.830
-: Welcome back.

00:01.830 --> 00:04.260
In this section we are going to implement the

00:04.260 --> 00:07.590
Kubernetes Ingress SSL use case.

00:07.590 --> 00:10.050
So let's understand the tasks involved

00:10.050 --> 00:14.010
as part of this ALB Ingress SSL use case.

00:14.010 --> 00:15.600
And before going to tasks,

00:15.600 --> 00:17.520
we also need to know that we are also going

00:17.520 --> 00:21.330
to introduce two more services as part of this use case.

00:21.330 --> 00:26.100
Which is AWS Route 53 and AWS Certificate Manager.

00:26.100 --> 00:27.690
So as part of task one,

00:27.690 --> 00:32.340
we are going to register a new domain in AWS Route 53.

00:32.340 --> 00:34.980
So this is just to learn how to register a domain

00:34.980 --> 00:36.577
in our AWS Route 53.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.540
And as part of task two,

00:39.540 --> 00:42.270
we are going to create a SSL certificate

00:42.270 --> 00:44.790
in AWS Certificate Manager.

00:44.790 --> 00:47.160
And as part of task three,

00:47.160 --> 00:50.010
we are going to update the SSL annotations

00:50.010 --> 00:52.110
in the Ingress service,

00:52.110 --> 00:54.690
and deploy those Kubernetes manifests

00:54.690 --> 00:57.450
and then test it using task four.

00:57.450 --> 01:01.020
So let's also understand the network design for this.

01:01.020 --> 01:02.760
So whatever we are seeing currently,

01:02.760 --> 01:05.250
is a network design we have used and seen

01:05.250 --> 01:08.190
already in the Context Path Based Route Routing

01:08.190 --> 01:10.290
use case or demo.

01:10.290 --> 01:14.513
So now we are also going to add AWS Route 53

01:14.513 --> 01:18.030
related service here and also ensure that we register

01:18.030 --> 01:22.110
a new domain inside this Route 53 service.

01:22.110 --> 01:24.990
And we are also going to create a SSL certificate

01:24.990 --> 01:27.540
in the Certificate Manager Service.

01:27.540 --> 01:31.170
And we are also going to update our Ingress Service

01:31.170 --> 01:34.440
with SSL related annotations.

01:34.440 --> 01:38.430
And finally, we are also going to DNS register

01:38.430 --> 01:41.310
our application load balancer DNS name,

01:41.310 --> 01:45.450
with a custom DNS name with the, with something like

01:45.450 --> 01:47.760
SSL Demo Docs, taxsimplified.com

01:47.760 --> 01:50.970
in the Route 53 Azure record.

01:50.970 --> 01:54.090
And whenever we access HTTP URLs,

01:54.090 --> 01:56.820
all three applications, app one, app two and then app three,

01:56.820 --> 01:58.860
should be accessible for us.

01:58.860 --> 02:01.980
And we, we will be also able to access using

02:01.980 --> 02:05.787
HTTPS, SSL Demo Docs taxsimplified.com

02:05.787 --> 02:07.530
for all the three applications

02:07.530 --> 02:09.960
with their respective context path.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.420
And in next demo, in addition to this,

02:12.420 --> 02:15.990
we are also going to implement a SSL redirect.

02:15.990 --> 02:19.363
So whenever you access the HTTP URLs also,

02:19.363 --> 02:22.320
it will directly redirect to HTTP URLs.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.360
But that is in the next demo.

02:24.360 --> 02:28.110
In this demo, we will see the URLs in a independent model

02:28.110 --> 02:30.180
where you can access the application

02:30.180 --> 02:34.890
with both HTTP and also HTTPS URLs.

02:34.890 --> 02:39.000
Now, to register a domain in AWS Route 53,

02:39.000 --> 02:42.210
already taxsimplified.com is a registered domain

02:42.210 --> 02:45.000
which we are using for all of our websites.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.740
So that said, to implement or demonstrate this use case,

02:49.740 --> 02:54.000
we are going to use a new domain named, cubancloud.com.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.950
So this completes the introductory

02:55.950 --> 02:58.890
part of Ingress SSL use case.

02:58.890 --> 03:00.390
In our next lecture we'll go ahead

03:00.390 --> 03:02.820
and then practically implement this.

03:02.820 --> 03:04.470
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

03:04.470 --> 03:05.640
Until then, bye bye.

03:05.640 --> 03:06.473
Thank you.
