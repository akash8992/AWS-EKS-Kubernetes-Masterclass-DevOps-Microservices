00:00.150 --> 00:00.983
-: Welcome back.

00:00.983 --> 00:01.816
In this lecture

00:01.816 --> 00:05.010
we are going to register a domain in Route 53.

00:05.010 --> 00:07.610
So we are going to buy the domain 'Kubeoncloud.com'.

00:08.580 --> 00:11.730
So let's go to AWS management console

00:11.730 --> 00:14.937
and on the console home search for 'Route 53'.

00:17.700 --> 00:22.560
And in Route 53 we'll go further, 'Register domains'.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.750
and then we are going to register a domain.

00:24.750 --> 00:28.230
And the domain name is going to be 'Kubeoncloud.com'.

00:31.050 --> 00:33.613
Okay, so it took something else here.

00:33.613 --> 00:35.190
Remove 'R' here.

00:35.190 --> 00:36.603
Yeah, check it. Okay.

00:38.850 --> 00:42.090
And we got it 'Kubeoncloud.com'.

00:42.090 --> 00:43.380
So everything looks good.

00:43.380 --> 00:46.710
K u b e on cloud.com right?

00:46.710 --> 00:48.333
So 'Add to cart'

00:48.333 --> 00:49.200
(mouse clicks)

00:49.200 --> 00:52.290
and go down. And if you see here,

00:52.290 --> 00:54.200
you can click on 'Continue'.

00:55.140 --> 00:57.000
And these are the personal information.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.840
We can leave it and you can see 'Privacy protection enabled'

01:00.840 --> 01:02.910
for my domain, enabled.

01:02.910 --> 01:05.010
And then I'll click on continue.

01:05.010 --> 01:06.397
And if I go here,

01:06.397 --> 01:09.330
"Do you want to automatically renew your domain?"

01:09.330 --> 01:11.310
Yes, I want to renew it.

01:11.310 --> 01:14.790
And terms and conditions, I'm going to accept it

01:14.790 --> 01:18.390
and then click on 'Complete the order'.

01:18.390 --> 01:21.060
So our order got submitted successfully.

01:21.060 --> 01:24.030
It might take close to three days to complete it usually

01:24.030 --> 01:27.510
but once we verify our payment, usually it might be faster

01:27.510 --> 01:30.720
in a day or even lesser than that.

01:30.720 --> 01:34.770
So we'll go to 'Domains' and my other domain is

01:34.770 --> 01:36.780
an action required for verified payment.

01:36.780 --> 01:40.260
I will leave it, once this also comes into that same status

01:40.260 --> 01:42.390
we will verify for this one.

01:42.390 --> 01:43.920
Okay, Kubeoncloud dot.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.550
So I got the action required for Q1 cloud.

01:47.550 --> 01:49.836
So I'll go there at the end

01:49.836 --> 01:54.690
and then I'll do the 'Verify payment' for the latest one.

01:54.690 --> 01:56.493
Okay, 1219, I'll go there.

01:58.030 --> 02:00.030
(mouse clicks)

02:00.030 --> 02:03.510
So one, I accidentally sent it so I really don't want to pay

02:03.510 --> 02:04.920
for the other one.

02:04.920 --> 02:09.240
So, now if you see 483302601 and then 2877.

02:11.580 --> 02:13.710
So 2877 is the latest.

02:13.710 --> 02:17.880
I'm going to say 'Verify' and then 'Pay', right?

02:17.880 --> 02:20.133
So I'm going to pay it now.

02:21.705 --> 02:24.480
(mouse clicks)

02:24.480 --> 02:27.753
So let's wait for the payment to happen.

02:31.080 --> 02:35.160
Okay, I provided the OTP and this should be done now.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.650
So we have completed the payments

02:37.650 --> 02:42.240
if you go for bills, orders and then invoices.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.560
So one should be like that only

02:43.560 --> 02:45.600
and then one should be already paid.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.240
Okay, so let's wait for some time

02:48.240 --> 02:52.320
or go to 'Register domains here' and then 'Pending request'.

02:52.320 --> 02:55.590
Okay, so it'll take an hour to update the status.

02:55.590 --> 02:58.140
So let's wait for an hour to see what happens.

02:58.140 --> 03:01.860
So once we, once we have completed the verify and pay

03:01.860 --> 03:04.639
so we can see that for 'Kubeoncloud'.

03:04.639 --> 03:06.900
we can see domain illustration is in progress.

03:06.900 --> 03:10.200
So let's wait for everything to be completed now.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.760
So within an hour, I have seen

03:11.760 --> 03:13.560
that my request has been moved

03:13.560 --> 03:16.860
from 'Pending request' to 'Register domains'.

03:16.860 --> 03:18.867
So hardly within less than two hours,

03:18.867 --> 03:21.570
entire process will be completed

03:21.570 --> 03:24.930
for us for the 'Register a domain' and only

03:24.930 --> 03:27.780
one thing is we need to verify our payment thoroughly.

03:27.780 --> 03:28.890
That's about it.

03:28.890 --> 03:32.460
So now I have the 'Kubeoncloud' domain available for me,

03:32.460 --> 03:34.140
'Kubeoncloud.com'.

03:34.140 --> 03:37.050
And then it's a strength is verified

03:37.050 --> 03:39.120
and we can see all the details about it.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.830
If you want to extend this domain

03:40.830 --> 03:42.750
for another nine to ten years if you want

03:42.750 --> 03:44.520
you can do that now.

03:44.520 --> 03:48.000
Okay. And auto renew is anyway enabled.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.900
So every year it will automatically get auto renewed.

03:51.900 --> 03:54.120
So now one important thing here is if you click

03:54.120 --> 03:57.030
on 'Manage DNS', it will take us to the hosted zone.

03:57.030 --> 04:01.080
So the public hosted zone for Kubeoncloud.com

04:01.080 --> 04:03.900
is already by default created. Okay?

04:03.900 --> 04:08.430
So now here we will be able to DNS register our domains.

04:08.430 --> 04:10.890
Okay? So whatever the sub domains we want to

04:10.890 --> 04:13.440
register or whatever the main domains we want to register

04:13.440 --> 04:15.840
we can create a record set here

04:15.840 --> 04:18.810
and then say that users dot Kubeoncloud.com

04:18.810 --> 04:23.810
and then provide the IP address or the ELB DNS name

04:24.180 --> 04:27.990
ELB DNS name, all these things here to DNS, register it.

04:27.990 --> 04:31.920
Okay, so this is about the 'Resistor domain' section

04:31.920 --> 04:33.540
which is nothing but our step two.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.580
'Register a domain' in Route 53.

04:35.580 --> 04:37.050
In our next lecture, we'll focus

04:37.050 --> 04:40.650
on creating a SSL certificate in 'Certificate Manager'.

04:40.650 --> 04:42.240
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.833
Until then bye bye. Thank you.
