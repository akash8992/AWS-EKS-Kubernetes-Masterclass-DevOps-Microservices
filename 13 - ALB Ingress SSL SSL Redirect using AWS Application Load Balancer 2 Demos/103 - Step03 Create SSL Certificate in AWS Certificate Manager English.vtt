00:00.000 --> 00:01.470
Instructor: Welcome back.

00:01.470 --> 00:04.260
Let's go back to our GitHub repository and

00:04.260 --> 00:05.093
we are entering

00:05.093 --> 00:09.360
into the section 0804 ALB Ingress, SSL.

00:09.360 --> 00:10.830
So as part of step two,

00:10.830 --> 00:12.450
we already registered it,

00:12.450 --> 00:15.960
new domain named q1cloud.com.

00:15.960 --> 00:18.360
But, for all our examples are demos,

00:18.360 --> 00:20.970
we are going to use our standard domain

00:20.970 --> 00:22.590
StackSimplified.com here.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.030
This is just to learn how

00:24.030 --> 00:26.730
to register a domain name in Route 53.

00:26.730 --> 00:28.590
So now we'll go to step three,

00:28.590 --> 00:30.810
which is creating a SSL certificate

00:30.810 --> 00:33.030
in certificate manager.

00:33.030 --> 00:36.780
So let's go to AWS Management Console

00:36.780 --> 00:40.470
and go to certificate manager service.

00:40.470 --> 00:42.570
And in certificate manager service,

00:42.570 --> 00:46.290
we are going to create a new certificate and

00:46.290 --> 00:48.330
we are also going to call this certificate

00:48.330 --> 00:49.950
as a wildcard certificate.

00:49.950 --> 00:53.490
Which means, with any domain, sub domain name,

00:53.490 --> 00:55.860
this respective certificate should work.

00:55.860 --> 00:57.780
Which means, we are going to give

00:57.780 --> 00:59.640
or generate a certificate named

00:59.640 --> 01:02.220
star.StackSimplified.com.

01:02.220 --> 01:04.950
Or star.yourdomain.com.

01:04.950 --> 01:07.500
So which is called a wildcard certificate.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.510
So we'll click on request.

01:09.510 --> 01:11.820
And request a public certificate.

01:11.820 --> 01:13.650
And we'll click on next

01:13.650 --> 01:17.430
and provide the fully qualified domain name here.

01:17.430 --> 01:18.630
So I'm going to provide it

01:18.630 --> 01:23.490
as star.StackSimplified.com, right.

01:23.490 --> 01:26.610
So this is called wildcard certificate, wherein,

01:26.610 --> 01:28.890
all the sub domains are supported here.

01:28.890 --> 01:32.726
Which means SSL demo 101StackSimplified.com,

01:32.726 --> 01:34.680
abc.StackSimplified.com

01:34.680 --> 01:36.960
so whatever may be my sub domain name.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.570
So everything will be supported here

01:39.570 --> 01:42.210
for the SSL certificate.

01:42.210 --> 01:43.200
Which means, we'll not,

01:43.200 --> 01:45.840
whenever you are using this SSL certificate

01:45.840 --> 01:47.880
and using any sub domain name,

01:47.880 --> 01:48.713
we are not going

01:48.713 --> 01:51.780
to get any SSL certificate popup error

01:51.780 --> 01:53.550
on the browser.

01:53.550 --> 01:55.110
So, and we have provided

01:55.110 --> 01:57.270
the qualified domain name here,

01:57.270 --> 01:59.430
star.StackSimplified.com

01:59.430 --> 02:02.160
and we need to select the validation method.

02:02.160 --> 02:05.790
So we are going to use the DNS validation method.

02:05.790 --> 02:09.330
And we'll click on request, right.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.630
And you can see here, let's wait for it.

02:12.630 --> 02:16.350
So you can see, this is the respective certificate

02:16.350 --> 02:17.490
it has created and

02:17.490 --> 02:19.740
it is saying pending validation.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.460
So let's go to that respective certificate here.

02:23.460 --> 02:26.790
And we can see, it, we need to create a records

02:26.790 --> 02:30.450
in Route 53 for the DNS validation to complete.

02:30.450 --> 02:33.630
So we need to complete the DNS validation step.

02:33.630 --> 02:36.330
So we'll click records in Route 53 here.

02:36.330 --> 02:38.190
So pending validation, so we'll click

02:38.190 --> 02:39.180
on create records

02:39.180 --> 02:42.330
in Route 53, and it is going to automatically

02:42.330 --> 02:45.090
add the records in Route 53.

02:45.090 --> 02:47.073
So create records.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.610
Records successfully added in Route 53.

02:53.610 --> 02:55.680
So let's click on the certificate ID and

02:55.680 --> 02:56.730
verify the same.

02:56.730 --> 03:00.210
So we can see here domains and it is success.

03:00.210 --> 03:02.280
And it has created a CNAME record

03:02.280 --> 03:03.780
with these names.

03:03.780 --> 03:07.470
So we can go to Route 53 surveys, right.

03:07.470 --> 03:11.460
And go to hostedzonesStackSimplified.com, right.

03:11.460 --> 03:13.540
So let's go to hosted zones here.

03:13.540 --> 03:14.700
Where is it?

03:14.700 --> 03:18.090
Here? And in hosted zones, We'll go

03:18.090 --> 03:20.820
to StackSimplified.com and

03:20.820 --> 03:22.590
in StackSimplified.com.

03:22.590 --> 03:25.500
So let's search further, CNAME record

03:25.500 --> 03:28.140
with this value.

03:28.140 --> 03:30.490
So copy and

03:33.930 --> 03:36.150
see if we can find that same thing here.

03:36.150 --> 03:38.280
It successfully create that,

03:38.280 --> 03:40.413
that CNAME record number hosted zone,

03:41.334 --> 03:43.200
which means our DNS validation is successful.

03:43.200 --> 03:47.220
And this respective certificate status is issued.

03:47.220 --> 03:51.060
So this completes the creation of SSL certificate.

03:51.060 --> 03:52.740
In our next lecture, we are going

03:52.740 --> 03:56.370
to work on Ingress SSL related annotations.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.960
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.160
Until then, bye by.

03:59.160 --> 03:59.993
Thank you.
