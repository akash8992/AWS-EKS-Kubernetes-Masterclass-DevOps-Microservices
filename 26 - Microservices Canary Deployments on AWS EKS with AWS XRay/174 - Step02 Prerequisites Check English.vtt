00:00.120 --> 00:00.953
-: Welcome back.

00:00.953 --> 00:02.850
In step two, we are going to look into

00:02.850 --> 00:06.637
prerequisites required for our this section implementation.

00:06.637 --> 00:07.470
So as usual,

00:07.470 --> 00:11.851
we need to have the AWS database up and running.

00:11.851 --> 00:15.517
So because we are using the My Skill External Service

00:15.517 --> 00:17.068
and then we are referencing the same thing

00:17.068 --> 00:21.133
in our user management deployment service.

00:21.133 --> 00:23.384
So next thing is we also need to ensure

00:23.384 --> 00:26.095
that we have our ALB ingress controller

00:26.095 --> 00:29.330
and then external DNS port up and running

00:29.330 --> 00:30.790
because we are going to use

00:30.790 --> 00:34.380
the ALB ingress related manifest here

00:34.380 --> 00:36.540
and also leverage the external DNS

00:36.540 --> 00:41.540
for registering the cany demo dot qan cloud.com in Route 53.

00:41.627 --> 00:43.325
And in addition to that,

00:43.325 --> 00:47.325
we also need to ensure that Xray demos up and running.

00:47.325 --> 00:50.640
So for the fact that we are going to

00:50.640 --> 00:53.530
leverage all the Xray related ports here

00:54.450 --> 00:56.910
which means Xray related demo set is deployed

00:56.910 --> 00:58.200
and then it should be up and running.

00:58.200 --> 01:01.530
Those things we need to ensure those are running.

01:01.530 --> 01:03.960
So let's crosscheck our ingress is up and running.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.679
So in every section this is a common prerequisite step,

01:06.679 --> 01:09.338
but if it is not mentioned,

01:09.338 --> 01:10.879
then by any chance we have issues.

01:10.879 --> 01:14.340
So then this prerequisite step is the core thing

01:14.340 --> 01:16.150
that these need to be required

01:16.150 --> 01:18.727
for those templates, whatever built.

01:18.727 --> 01:22.238
So LB ingress controller, it should be up and running.

01:22.238 --> 01:26.700
And in default name space, we should have external DNS

01:26.700 --> 01:29.280
and then X-Ray Damon.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.990
So both should be up and running.

01:30.990 --> 01:32.401
So external DNS is up and running.

01:32.401 --> 01:36.480
And then Xray demos are up and running. Good.

01:36.480 --> 01:39.870
So this confirms that our prerequisites are good

01:39.870 --> 01:42.840
and if you want, you can go back to your RDS database

01:42.840 --> 01:44.160
and then crosscheck.

01:44.160 --> 01:47.297
And for RDS, you have an option to also use alternate

01:47.297 --> 01:48.630
which is nothing.

01:48.630 --> 01:51.120
But instead of using RDS database

01:51.120 --> 01:53.040
if you want to use in memory database

01:53.040 --> 01:57.480
just change this to 4.0.0 xray H two db.

01:57.480 --> 02:00.612
So the CME is also shown in ara hub dot doca

02:00.612 --> 02:02.374
dot com earlier also.

02:02.374 --> 02:04.050
So the same thing you can use

02:04.050 --> 02:06.780
for RDS database if you want to use that.

02:06.780 --> 02:09.526
But always try to ensure that we are using

02:09.526 --> 02:11.776
My Skill type of stuff so that we

02:11.776 --> 02:14.610
it means like when we are learning

02:14.610 --> 02:15.923
or when we are planning to learn also,

02:15.923 --> 02:19.710
we are leaning towards more real-time examples

02:19.710 --> 02:21.533
instead of some in memory stuff.

02:21.533 --> 02:25.710
But for backup also, I have provided this image for you

02:25.710 --> 02:26.737
and it is also going to work

02:26.737 --> 02:30.000
with all these use cases without any issues.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.980
Only thing is data is not going to persist

02:31.980 --> 02:35.936
if try to create user and then list users, all those things.

02:35.936 --> 02:37.500
That's about it.

02:37.500 --> 02:38.760
So in our next lecture,

02:38.760 --> 02:40.680
we'll focus on reviewing the manifest.

02:40.680 --> 02:41.949
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

02:41.949 --> 02:43.630
Until then, bye bye.

02:43.630 --> 02:44.733
Thank you.
