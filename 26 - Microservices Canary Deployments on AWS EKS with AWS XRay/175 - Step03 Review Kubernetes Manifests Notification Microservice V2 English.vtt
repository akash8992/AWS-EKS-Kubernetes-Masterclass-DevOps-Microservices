00:00.060 --> 00:02.370
-: Welcome back. In this lecture we are going to

00:02.370 --> 00:03.837
review the deployment manifest

00:03.837 --> 00:07.740
and also the English manifests required

00:07.740 --> 00:10.860
for our application deployment.

00:10.860 --> 00:12.930
So in step three we are going to review

00:12.930 --> 00:16.290
the deployment manifest for V2 notification service.

00:16.290 --> 00:18.720
So we are going to distribute 50% draft

00:18.720 --> 00:21.720
to each of the V1 and V2 version of application.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.700
So NSV1 replicas are two

00:23.700 --> 00:25.530
and then NSV2 replicas are two.

00:25.530 --> 00:27.420
We have put it there, even one one

00:27.420 --> 00:31.140
if you put also it is going to be 50% traffic.

00:31.140 --> 00:32.880
So if you see here this is the

00:32.880 --> 00:35.370
notification microservice deployment zero four.

00:35.370 --> 00:38.910
This is V1 notification and we have two replicas

00:38.910 --> 00:41.190
and zero eight V2 notification.

00:41.190 --> 00:42.840
We have two replicas.

00:42.840 --> 00:45.630
Okay? And the next thing is verify means

00:45.630 --> 00:46.830
like the change one is

00:46.830 --> 00:50.463
in the zero eight V2 notification microservice

00:50.463 --> 00:54.998
your image tag should be 4.0.0 a double s x-ray.

00:54.998 --> 00:56.790
So verify the same thing.

00:56.790 --> 00:57.623
It is the same.

00:57.623 --> 00:59.430
And if you go for a V1

00:59.430 --> 01:01.852
it should be 3.0.0 a double s x-ray.

01:01.852 --> 01:03.499
So that looks good.

01:03.499 --> 01:07.560
And next is change to new environmental variables

01:07.560 --> 01:10.110
will be added here so these things are going to be same

01:10.110 --> 01:13.134
which is XLA context missing and then X name and address.

01:13.134 --> 01:15.540
But X-ray tracing name

01:15.540 --> 01:19.590
we are going to give it as V2 notification microservice

01:19.590 --> 01:21.300
so that you get the name here.

01:21.300 --> 01:23.453
V2 notification microservice in

01:23.453 --> 01:28.020
from x-ray picture visual service map view.

01:28.020 --> 01:30.180
Okay, so that's about notification

01:30.180 --> 01:33.233
microservice related review of that respect to manifest and

01:33.233 --> 01:37.860
rest all manifests are same my ask user management

01:37.860 --> 01:38.940
from previous sections.

01:38.940 --> 01:41.310
It is coming as is so we really don't need to

01:41.310 --> 01:42.390
worry about them.

01:42.390 --> 01:44.910
So next we will move on to ingress manifest.

01:44.910 --> 01:47.310
Okay, so let's go to ingress manifest.

01:47.310 --> 01:49.890
And first thing is SSL certificate.

01:49.890 --> 01:51.420
This is for you in the sense

01:51.420 --> 01:53.809
like whenever you are using this manifest

01:53.809 --> 01:57.438
please add your SSL certificate here and here.

01:57.438 --> 02:01.309
And the second thing is external dns, right?

02:01.309 --> 02:04.920
So for external dns, so you can use means

02:04.920 --> 02:07.830
like I'm using Canary demo dot coupon cloud.com.

02:07.830 --> 02:10.937
In your case, the coupon cloud.com might be something

02:10.937 --> 02:13.207
of your domain.com.

02:13.207 --> 02:16.320
So that's about the ingress manifest changes.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.991
And if you want we can even change

02:17.991 --> 02:22.470
E case micro services demo and the name of this is Canary.

02:22.470 --> 02:25.115
If you want we can even add this way forever

02:25.115 --> 02:27.840
ingress manifest name.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.580
Okay, so that's about it.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.200
So rest all looks good.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.840
And then as is, so in our next lecture

02:33.840 --> 02:36.067
we are going to deploy and then test the stuff.

02:36.067 --> 02:38.700
So I'll see you in the next lecture.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.930
Until then, bye bye.

02:39.930 --> 02:40.763
Thank you.
